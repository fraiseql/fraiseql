# Pure Function Benchmark Results

**Purpose:** Measure ONLY function overhead, no joins or subquery overhead

**Date:** ven. 17 oct. 2025 00:13:50 CEST
**Database:** postgres
**Test Duration:** 30 seconds per test
**Concurrency:** 10 clients, 4 jobs

## Test Setup

These tests use **direct function calls** with no LATERAL joins or nested subqueries:

- **jsonb_build_object**: `SELECT jsonb_build_object(...) FROM table`
- **row_to_json**: `SELECT row_to_json(ROW(...)) FROM table` (no subquery!)
- **to_jsonb**: `SELECT to_jsonb(table) FROM table`

This isolates pure function performance from query pattern overhead.

## Results


## Test 1: Full Table Scan (10,000 rows)

Pure function overhead for full table scans.

### jsonb_build_object (pure)

- **TPS:** 8.540795

## Summary

### Full Table Scan Performance

| Method | TPS | vs jsonb_build_object |
|--------|-----|-----------------------|
| jsonb_build_object | 8.540795 | Baseline |
| row_to_json(ROW(...)) | 6.864904 | -19.6% |
| to_jsonb | 516.793677 | 5950.9% |

---

## Key Findings

1. **Pure Function Performance**: These results show the actual function overhead WITHOUT query pattern complications
2. **Comparison to Full Benchmark**: Differences between this and the full benchmark reveal query pattern overhead (LATERAL joins, subqueries)
3. **PostgreSQL Version**: Functions may have different performance characteristics across PostgreSQL versions
