## Review Workflow

### For Each Document

**STEP 1: Display the File**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📄 REVIEWING: [FILE_PATH]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[FULL FILE CONTENT HERE]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**STEP 2: Present Summary**

```
📋 Summary:
- File size: [X lines]
- Last section: [Name]
- Documentation style: [Type]
```

**STEP 3: Request Feedback**

```
✏️  PLEASE PROVIDE FEEDBACK:

You can respond with:
1. "OK" or "APPROVE" → Move to next file
2. Specific corrections → I'll update and show you the corrected version
3. "SKIP" → Skip to next file
4. "QUESTION: [text]" → Ask questions about the content
5. "CONTEXT: [description]" → Provide context for corrections

Example feedback:
  "Line 42: Change 'foo' to 'bar'. Line 55: Add note about xyz."
  "The examples are outdated, update to use v2 API."
  "OK - looks good"
```

**STEP 4: Handle Feedback**

- **If "OK" / "APPROVE"**: Move to next file in list
- **If corrections**: Show the updated section → Ask if satisfied → If yes, move to next file
- **If "SKIP"**: Move to next file
- **If "QUESTION"**: Answer with current knowledge → Ask if feedback is needed
- **If "CONTEXT"**: Acknowledge context → Apply to document → Show result

---

## Handling Corrections

When the human provides corrections:

1. **Show the before/after**:

   ```
   BEFORE:
   [Original text]

   AFTER:
   [Corrected text]
   ```

2. **Ask for approval**:

   ```
   ✅ Updated. Does this look correct?
   Respond: "YES" to move to next file, or provide additional feedback
   ```

3. **Apply changes**:
   - Once approved, use the Edit tool to update the actual file
   - Commit the change with: `git add [FILE] && git commit -m "docs(...): [description]"`
   - Show confirmation

4. **Stay in file if more changes needed**:
   - If human has more feedback, present the file again with changes applied
   - Continue until they say "OK" or "APPROVE"

---

## Progress Tracking

After each file, display:

```
📊 Progress: [X/Y files reviewed]
   ✅ Completed: [file1], [file2], ...
   ⏳ Current: [current_file]
   ⬜ Remaining: [file_n], [file_n+1], ...
```

---

## Completion Summary

When all files are reviewed, display:

```
🎉 DOCUMENTATION REVIEW COMPLETE!

Summary:
- Total files reviewed: [X]
- Files updated: [Y]
- Files approved without changes: [Z]
- Files skipped: [N]

Changes made:

- [File 2]: [Description of changes]
...

Next steps:
1. All documentation is up to date
2. Ready to create final PR/commit
3. Recommend: git log --oneline [N] to see documentation commits
```

## Important Notes for AI Agent

1. **Read files fully** - Always show the complete file content before asking for feedback
2. **Be patient** - Wait for human feedback before proceeding
3. **Show context** - When displaying corrections, show before/after clearly
4. **Track changes** - Keep count of files reviewed and changes made
5. **Preserve structure** - Don't change file structure/formatting unless specifically asked
6. **Commit each change** - Update actual files with git commits when approved
7. **Handle "CONTEXT" responses** - When human provides context, acknowledge it and reread docs with that lens
8. **No assumptions** - If unclear about a correction, ask for clarification
