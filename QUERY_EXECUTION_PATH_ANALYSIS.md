# Query Execution Path Analysis

Analysis of query execution paths in FraiseQL.

## Overview

This document analyzes how queries flow through FraiseQL from GraphQL input to database execution.

## Execution Flow

### 1. GraphQL Request

```
Client → GraphQL Query → FraiseQL Router
```

### 2. Query Parsing

```
GraphQL AST → FraiseQL Type System → SQL Generation
```

### 3. Database Execution

```
SQL Query → PostgreSQL → View Resolution → Results
```

### 4. JSON Processing

```
Database Results → Rust JSON Transform → GraphQL Response
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Parsing (< 1ms)
- GraphQL AST parsing
- Type resolution
- Validation

### SQL Generation (< 1ms)
- WHERE clause generation
- JOIN resolution
- ORDER BY clauses

### Database Execution (1-50ms)
- Varies by query complexity
- View-based reads are optimized
- Index utilization critical

### JSON Processing (< 1ms)
- Rust-powered transformation
- CamelCase conversion
- Field filtering

## Optimization Points

1. **Query Complexity Limiting**
   - Prevent expensive queries
   - Depth limiting
   - Field count limits

2. **Database Views**
   - Pre-computed joins
   - Materialized views for aggregations
   - Index optimization

3. **Rust JSON Pipeline**
   - Zero-copy transformations
   - Efficient memory usage
   - Parallel processing

4. **Caching**
   - APQ (Automatic Persisted Queries)
   - Result caching
   - Schema caching

## Profiling

Enable query profiling:

```python
from fraiseql import FraiseQLConfig

config = FraiseQLConfig(
    enable_profiling=True,
    log_queries=True
)
```

## Benchmarks

See [benchmarks/](benchmarks/) for detailed performance benchmarks.
