# FraiseQL v1 - Vision Synthesis Complete ‚úÖ

**Date**: October 16, 2025
**Status**: Planning complete, unified vision ready, Week 1 can start immediately

---

## üéâ What Just Happened

Your FraiseQL v1 planning documents have been **synthesized into a single, unified vision** focused on:
- **Goal**: Hiring (Staff+ engineering roles)
- **Strategy**: Clean rebuild from scratch
- **Timeline**: 8 weeks to interview-ready
- **Outcome**: Portfolio-quality showcase of architectural mastery

---

## üìã Document Organization

### ‚úÖ **PRIMARY VISION DOCUMENT**

**`/V1_VISION.md`** - Your single source of truth (1,400+ lines)

**Contains**:
- Why this rebuild (hiring-focused)
- Core architecture patterns (Trinity + Functions as DEFAULT)
- All 5 component specifications
- Complete 8-week timeline
- Interview talking points (60-second pitch!)
- Success criteria
- Action plan for Week 1

**This is your master plan.** Everything you need is here.

---

### ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTORY**

**`fraiseql-v1/`** - Clean slate for implementation

**Structure**:
```
fraiseql-v1/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Updated to reference V1_VISION.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                  # Empty, ready for Week 1
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/              # Empty, ready for Week 7
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/fraiseql/          # Skeleton created (211 LOC)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                 # Empty, ready for testing
```

**Status**: Ready for Week 1 (documentation phase)

---

### ‚úÖ **REFERENCE DOCUMENTS** (Keep These)

These were synthesized into V1_VISION.md but remain useful as detailed references:

1. **`V1_COMPONENT_PRDS.md`**
   - Detailed specifications for all 5 components
   - API designs with code examples
   - Testing strategies
   - **Use When**: Implementing each component (Week 3-7)

2. **`V1_ADVANCED_PATTERNS.md`**
   - Complete Trinity identifier pattern (1,165 lines)
   - Mutations as functions pattern
   - Full SQL examples
   - **Use When**: Writing database functions, setting up schema

3. **`V1_DOCUMENTATION_PLAN.md`**
   - Documentation structure
   - Writing strategy
   - Templates for each doc
   - **Use When**: Writing docs (Week 1-2)

4. **`V1_PATTERN_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md`**
   - Quick reference for naming conventions
   - Migration checklist
   - **Use When**: Need quick lookup of naming rules

---

### üóÉÔ∏è **ARCHIVED DOCUMENTS** (Future v2 Material)

**`_archive/v2_planning/`** - Production-focused strategies for later

**Moved Here**:
1. `V1_TDD_PLAN.md` ‚Üí Actually about v0 production readiness (not v1 rebuild)
2. `ROADMAP_V1_UPDATED.md` ‚Üí Production evolution with enterprise features (17 weeks)
3. `ROADMAP_V1.md` ‚Üí Original production roadmap

**Why Archived**:
- Conflicted with hiring-focused rebuild strategy
- These describe evolving v0 to production, not clean rebuild
- May become v2 roadmap after v1 succeeds

**When to Revisit**:
- After landing a job ‚Üí Mission accomplished!
- If pivoting to production adoption ‚Üí Unarchive and follow

---

## üéØ What Changed vs Original Plans

### **Resolved Conflicts**

**Before**: Two conflicting strategies
1. Blueprint: Clean rebuild in 8 weeks for hiring
2. Roadmap: Evolve v0 in 17 weeks for production

**After**: Single unified strategy
- ‚úÖ Clean rebuild (Blueprint approach)
- ‚úÖ 8-week timeline
- ‚úÖ Hiring-focused
- ‚úÖ Production strategy archived for later

### **Clarified Scope**

**Before**: Uncertain scope (5 components vs 20+ features)

**After**: Crystal clear
- Exactly 5 core components (~3,000 LOC)
- Trinity + Functions as DEFAULT patterns
- Remove v0 feature bloat
- Quality over quantity

### **Unified Timeline**

**Before**: Conflicting timelines (8 weeks vs 17 weeks)

**After**: Single 8-week plan
- Week 1-2: Documentation (philosophy-first)
- Week 3-6: Implementation (5 components)
- Week 7-8: Examples & Polish

## üí° Key Decisions Made

### **Goal**: Hiring ‚úÖ
- Primary outcome: Land Staff+ role
- Secondary outcome: Showcase portfolio
- **NOT** primary: Production adoption (that's v2)

### **Strategy**: Rebuild from scratch ‚úÖ
- Start in clean `fraiseql-v1/` directory
- Port only best 5 components from v0
- Remove 94% of v0 code (50K ‚Üí 3K LOC)
- **NOT**: Evolve v0 with new features

### **Timeline**: 8 weeks ‚úÖ
- Documentation-first (Week 1-2)
- Implementation (Week 3-6)
- Examples & Polish (Week 7-8)
- **NOT**: 17-week production timeline

### **Patterns**: Trinity + Functions as DEFAULT ‚úÖ
- Trinity identifiers: pk_*, fk_*, id, identifier
- Mutations as PostgreSQL functions
- CQRS with explicit sync
- **NOT**: Simple UUID-only or ORM patterns
