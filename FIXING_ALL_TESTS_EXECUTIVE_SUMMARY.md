## 📊 The 44 Skipped Tests

| Category | Count | Priority | Time | Notes |
|----------|-------|----------|------|-------|
| **Rust JSON Bugs** | 5 | 🔥 CRITICAL | 2-3 days | Blocks nested object filtering |
| **Obsolete Tests** | 17 | 🟢 CAN DELETE | 2 hours | Old dual-mode architecture |
| **Blog Templates** | 10 | 🟡 MEDIUM | 1-2 days | Example apps failing |
| **JSON Validation** | 1 | 🟡 MEDIUM | 1 day | Single validation test |
| **Shellcheck** | 1 | 🟢 LOW | 1 hour | Missing linter |

---

## 🎯 The Plan

### Quick Start (First Day - 4 hours)

```bash
# Morning: Delete obsolete tests (2 hours)
# → -17 skipped tests immediately

# Afternoon: Install shellcheck and fix (2 hours)
# → -1 more skipped test

# Result: 26 skipped tests remaining (-41% reduction!)
```

### Week 1: Critical Bug

```
Days 1-3: Fix Rust JSON generation bug
- Reproduce and diagnose
- Fix in Python or wait for Rust fix
- Verify nested object filtering works

Result: -5 skipped tests (21 remaining)
```

### Week 2: Polish

```
Days 1-2: Fix blog template validation
Day 3: Fix JSON parsing validation

Result: 0 skipped tests! 🎉
```

---

## 🔥 The Critical Issue

**Problem**: Rust pipeline generates malformed JSON for nested object queries

**Example**:
```python
# This query produces malformed JSON:
where = {
    "machine": {"id": {"eq": machine_id}},  # Nested
    "is_current": {"eq": True}               # Direct
}
# Output: Missing closing braces, invalid JSON
```

**Impact**:
- Users can't filter on nested objects
- 5 tests skipped
- Blocks production use cases

**Solution**:
1. Reproduce bug with actual JSON output
2. Identify if Python wrapper or Rust crate issue
3. Fix or implement workaround
4. Add regression tests

**Risk**: May need to wait for Rust crate update (1-2 weeks)

## ⚡ Quick Wins Strategy

Instead of starting with the hardest problem, get early wins:

```
Hour 1-2:   Delete obsolete tests    → 44 → 27 skipped (-38%)
Hour 3-4:   Fix shellcheck           → 27 → 26 skipped (-4%)
Day 2-4:    Fix Rust bug             → 26 → 21 skipped (-11%)
Day 5-6:    Fix blog templates       → 21 → 11 skipped (-23%)
Day 7:      Fix JSON validation      → 11 → 10 skipped (-2%)
            All done!                → 0 skipped! 🚀
```

## 📞 Decision Required

**Do you want to**:

A. **Start with quick wins** (recommended)
   - Delete obsolete tests now
   - Get 41% reduction today
   - Then tackle hard problems

B. **Start with critical bug**
   - Fix Rust JSON issue first
   - Higher risk but fixes blocking issue
   - Quick wins can wait

C. **Review detailed plans first**
   - Study technical details
   - Understand all implications
   - Make informed decision

**My recommendation**: Option A - Start with quick wins for early momentum and morale boost, then tackle the hard Rust bug with confidence.

---

**Estimated completion**: 2 weeks from start
**Confidence level**: HIGH (with Rust bug workaround if needed)
**User impact**: CRITICAL (unblocks nested filtering)
