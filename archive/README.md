# FraiseQL Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that has been superseded or is no longer relevant to the current version.

## Structure

- `temp-work-files/` - Temporary planning and review documents from development
- `debug-sessions/` - CI/CD debugging session notes
- `migration-guides/` - Legacy migration guides (pre-v1.0.0)

## Why Archive?

These files are preserved for historical reference but removed from the main documentation to:
- Reduce confusion for new users
- Keep the repository clean
- Maintain development history
- Preserve debugging insights
