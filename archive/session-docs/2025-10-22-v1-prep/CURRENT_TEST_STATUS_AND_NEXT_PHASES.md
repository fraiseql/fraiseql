## ❌ Phase 6: Fix 13 Failing Tests 🔥 CRITICAL

**Priority**: HIGH (blocking release)
**Tests**: 13 failing
**Estimated Time**: 2-4 days

### Failure Categories

#### Category A: Field Name Conversion Issues (11 tests)

**Problem**: SQL generators are not converting camelCase field names to snake_case for JSONB queries.

**Affected Test Files**:
1. `test_end_to_end_ip_filtering_clean.py` (5 tests)
   - IP address filtering with camelCase fields
   - Expected: `data ->> 'server_ip'`
   - Actual: `data ->> 'serverIp'`

2. `test_end_to_end_ltree_filtering.py` (3 tests)
   - LTREE path filtering with camelCase fields
   - Expected: `data ->> 'category_path'`
   - Actual: `data ->> 'categoryPath'`

3. `test_end_to_end_mac_address_filtering.py` (3 tests)
   - MAC address filtering with camelCase fields
   - Expected: `data ->> 'mac_address'`
   - Actual: `data ->> 'deviceMac'`

**Root Cause**:
The SQL WHERE clause builder is not applying field name conversion before generating JSONB path expressions.

**Example Error**:
```python
# Test expects:
assert "data ->> 'server_ip'" in sql_str

# But gets:
"(data ->> 'serverIp')::inet = '192.168.1.1'::inet"
```

**Files Likely Involved**:
- `src/fraiseql/sql/where/core/sql_builder.py` - Main WHERE SQL generation
- `src/fraiseql/sql/operator_strategies.py` - Operator-specific SQL builders
- `src/fraiseql/utils/casing.py` - Field name conversion utilities

**Solution Approach**:
1. Identify where JSONB path generation happens
2. Add camelCase → snake_case conversion before path construction
3. Ensure conversion respects GraphQL schema field names
4. Add tests to verify conversion works for all scalar types

---

#### Category B: Blog Example Schema Issues (2 tests)

**Problem**: Blog example queries failing with schema/field errors.

**Affected Tests**:
1. `test_blog_simple_integration.py::test_blog_simple_basic_queries`
   - Error: `column "data" does not exist` in tags query
   - Path: `['tags']`

2. `test_blog_simple_integration.py::test_blog_simple_performance_baseline`
   - Error: `Cannot query field 'username' on type 'User'. Did you mean 'fullName'?`

**Root Cause Analysis**:

**Error 1: Missing "data" column**
```
column "data" does not exist
LINE 1: SELECT "data"::text FROM "tags" ORDER BY name ASC LIMIT 5
               ^
```
The `tags` view/table is missing the required `data` JSONB column that FraiseQL expects.

**Error 2: Invalid field name**
```
Cannot query field 'username' on type 'User'. Did you mean 'fullName'?
```
The GraphQL query is requesting `username` but the User type only has `fullName`.

**Files to Check**:
- `examples/blog_simple/schema.py` - Check User type definition
- `examples/blog_simple/db/schema.sql` - Check tags table/view definition
- `examples/blog_simple/queries/` - Check test queries

**Solution Approach**:
1. Review blog_simple schema definition
2. Ensure all views have required `data` JSONB column
3. Fix GraphQL queries to match actual schema
4. Update test expectations to match corrected schema

## 📝 Notes

### Why 13 Failures vs 11 Before?
The +2 failures are blog example tests that were previously skipped due to template issues. Phase 1's JSON fix allowed them to run, revealing underlying schema problems.

### Why 2 Skipped vs 23 Before?
- Phase 1: Fixed 5 critical + 15 bonus tests (no longer skipping)
- Phase 2: Archived 11 obsolete tests (removed from suite)
- Phase 3: Auto-fixed 10 blog template tests
- **Total reduction**: 21 tests no longer skipped

### Auto-Resolution of Phase 3
Blog template tests were failing because of the Rust JSON bug. When Phase 1 fixed the JSON generation, these tests started passing automatically. This is a good example of how fixing root causes can cascade to fix multiple symptoms.
