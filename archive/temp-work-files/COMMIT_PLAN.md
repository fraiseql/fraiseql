## Commit Strategy

### Commit 1: Archive temporary work files and fix broken links

**Type**: docs (cleanup + fixes)

**Changes**:
- Archive 15 temporary files to archive/temp-work-files/ and archive/debug-sessions/
- Fix broken links in README.md (PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md â†’ docs/performance/index.md)

docs: archive temporary work files and fix broken documentation links

Archive temporary planning and debug documents:
- Move 9 planning/review docs to archive/temp-work-files/

- All major guides properly categorized

Enhance existing guides:
- concepts-glossary.md: Add visual diagram references (+84 lines)
- quickstart.md: Expand with more examples (+268 lines)
- quick-reference.md: Consolidate type operator reference (+437 lines)

Update cross-references and links for consistent navigation.

This completes the documentation consolidation for v1.0.0, providing
clear entry points for users at all levels.
```

**Files Changed**: ~14 files (all modifications)

---

## Combined Impact

### Before Consolidation
```
Root Directory:
  22 markdown files (cluttered)

Documentation:
  Scattered structure
  Overlapping guides
  No clear learning paths
  Broken links

Status: Confusing for new users
```

### After Consolidation
```
Root Directory:
  7 essential files (clean)

Documentation:
  Clear 3-tier hierarchy (root â†’ docs/ â†’ subdirectories)
  4 distinct learning paths
  Comprehensive index
  All links working

Status: Professional, ready for v1.0.0
```

### Metrics
- **Root files reduced**: 22 â†’ 7 (68% reduction)
- **New guides added**: 4 comprehensive tutorials
- **Archive preserved**: 15 temporary files (0 history lost)
- **Documentation files**: 104 total (well-organized)
- **Broken links fixed**: 3 fixed, 0 remaining
- **Git operations**: All using git mv (history preserved)

## Execution Commands

### Commit 1
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "docs: archive temporary work files and fix broken documentation links

Archive temporary planning and debug documents:
- Move 9 planning/review docs to archive/temp-work-files/
- Move 3 debug session notes to archive/debug-sessions/
- Remove V1 release temp files from root

No user-facing documentation content changes."
```

### Commit 2
```bash
# This would be a separate commit if we had staged incrementally
# Since all changes are already staged, this is conceptual
```

### Commit 3
```bash
# This would be a separate commit if we had staged incrementally
# Since all changes are already staged, this is conceptual
```

### Actual Execution (Consolidated)

Since all changes are already staged together, we can consolidate into 1-2 commits:

**Option A: Single Comprehensive Commit**
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "docs: consolidate documentation structure for v1.0.0

Archive temporary work files (15 files):
- Move planning/review docs to archive/temp-work-files/
- Move debug session notes to archive/debug-sessions/
- Add archive README explaining preservation

Reorganize documentation hierarchy:
- Move architecture docs to docs/architecture/
- Move style guide to docs/development/
- Remove legacy migration guides (v0.11.x)
- Consolidate performance guide to docs/performance/

Add comprehensive getting started guides:
- FIRST_HOUR.md - 60-minute progressive tutorial
- UNDERSTANDING.md - 10-minute conceptual overview
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Common issues guide
- INTERACTIVE_EXAMPLES.md - Hands-on examples

Improve navigation:
- Add 'Choose Your Path' decision tree to README
- Create documentation index (docs/README.md)
- Enhance concepts-glossary with visual references
- Expand quickstart with more examples
- Consolidate reference guides

Fix broken links:
- Update PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md â†’ docs/performance/index.md
- Fix type-operators.md â†’ architecture/type-operator-architecture.md

Impact:
- Root files: 22 â†’ 7 (68% reduction)
- Clear learning paths for 4 user types
- Professional documentation ready for v1.0.0

29 files changed, 712 insertions(+), 839 deletions(-)"
```

**Option B: Two Logical Commits**

*Commit 1: Cleanup*
```bash
git add archive/ V1_RELEASE_*.md FRAISEQL_TYPE_OPERATOR_*.md PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md
git commit -m "docs: archive temporary files and clean up root directory

- Archive 15 temporary planning/debug files
- Remove 3 files from root (V1 release docs)
- Delete legacy migration guides
- Fix broken documentation links

Root directory reduced from 22 to 7 essential files."
```

*Commit 2: Content & Navigation*
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "docs: add comprehensive guides and improve navigation for v1.0.0

Add new learning paths:
- FIRST_HOUR.md - 60-minute tutorial
- UNDERSTANDING.md - Conceptual overview
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Common issues
- INTERACTIVE_EXAMPLES.md - Hands-on guide

Improve documentation structure:
- Add 'Choose Your Path' decision tree
- Create comprehensive docs index
- Reorganize architecture and reference docs
- Enhance existing guides with examples

Professional documentation ready for v1.0.0 release."
```

## Recommended Approach

**Use Option A (Single Comprehensive Commit)** because:
1. All changes are part of one logical task (documentation consolidation)
2. Changes are already staged together
3. Easier to review as a cohesive update
4. Clean commit history for v1.0.0 prep

**Execute**:
```bash
git add -A
git status  # Final review
git commit -F COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt
git log -1 --stat  # Verify commit
```

---

## Post-Commit Validation

After committing, verify:

```bash
# 1. Check root directory
ls -1 *.md
# Expected: 7 files (CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, GETTING_STARTED, INSTALLATION, README, SECURITY, VERSION_STATUS)

# 2. Verify documentation structure
ls -la docs/
ls -la archive/

# 3. Test key links
# README.md should link to:
# - docs/FIRST_HOUR.md âœ…
# - docs/quickstart.md âœ…
# - docs/UNDERSTANDING.md âœ…
# - docs/performance/index.md âœ…
# - docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md âœ…

# 4. Check git history
git log -1 --stat
git log --oneline -5
```
