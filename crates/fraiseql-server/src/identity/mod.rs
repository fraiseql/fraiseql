//! Enriched-identity resolution: a request-scoped `sub → DB → identity` mapping.
//!
//! Resolved once per request, cached, and fail-closed, it feeds both
//! read-scoping (session variables / injected params) and verified
//! sender-identity (`send_email`).
//!
//! # Structure
//!
//! - `query` — safe named-parameter binding (`$name` → positional `$N`, values bound out-of-band,
//!   never interpolated). Ported verbatim from #242, with the missing-param error refined to a
//!   structured `MissingParam`.
//! - `cache` — the identity cache (DESIGN §6): keyed on the bound-`$param` tuple, positive and
//!   negative TTL, `flush(sub)`.
//! - `failure` — the `IdentityResolution` model (DESIGN §5): `Resolved` / `Denied` / `Unavailable`,
//!   fail-closed at source.
//! - `resolver` — the shared `IdentityResolver`: bind → cache → fetch (≤2 rows) → classify → cache,
//!   with server-side denial logging.
//!
//! The read-path consumer (`apply::enrich_security_context`) is wired into the
//! `/graphql` handler, and the cache flush surface (`admin::identity_admin_router`)
//! into the admin API. The DB-backed sender is the one seam whose consumer lands
//! elsewhere (the hardening-train `send_email` op), so it carries a scoped
//! `dead_code` allow at its definition rather than a blanket module allow.
//!
//! Enrichment requires an authenticated subject, so the whole module is gated on
//! the `auth` feature (mirroring the `enrichment_pool` the resolver uses).
