## BATCH 1 — Test utility consolidation

**Risk**: Three inconsistent `DATABASE_URL` helpers with different error
semantics and default connection strings cause tests to behave differently
in CI vs. local dev depending on which file they happen to be in.
`fraiseql-test-utils` is nearly invisible despite providing exactly the
shared infrastructure each crate reimplements independently.

| ID    | Sev | Status | What | Where |
|-------|-----|--------|------|-------|
| TU-1  | 🟠  | ✅ Done | Add `database_url() -> String` to `fraiseql-test-utils` — panics with actionable message if `DATABASE_URL` is unset; uses no fallback (tests that run without a DB must be `#[ignore]`) | `crates/fraiseql-test-utils/src/db.rs` (new) |
| TU-2  | 🟠  | ✅ Done | Replace the three inconsistent inline `DATABASE_URL` patterns with `fraiseql_test_utils::database_url()` — `database_integration_test.rs` (silent fallback), `database_query_test.rs` (local `require_database_url`), `observer_test_helpers.rs` (auth-credentialed fallback) | `crates/fraiseql-server/tests/` |
| TU-3  | 🟡  | ✅ Done | Move observer test setup from `observer_test_helpers.rs` into `fraiseql-test-utils::observers` submodule — exposes `ObserverTestHarness`, `cleanup_test_data()`, and `get_test_id()` to all crates | `crates/fraiseql-test-utils/src/observers.rs` (new) |
| TU-4  | 🟡  | ✅ Done | Add `fraiseql-test-utils` as `[dev-dependencies]` to `fraiseql-observers/Cargo.toml` and replace any duplicated setup code in that crate's tests | `crates/fraiseql-observers/Cargo.toml` |
| TU-5  | 🟡  | ✅ Done | Document `fraiseql-test-utils` in its crate-level `//!` doc comment with a usage table listing every public helper, its purpose, and a one-line example | `crates/fraiseql-test-utils/src/lib.rs` |
| TU-6  | 🟡  | ✅ Done | Assert adoption in CI: add a `tools/check-test-imports.sh` script that greps for bare `std::env::var("DATABASE_URL")` in `tests/` directories and fails if any remain after this batch | `tools/check-test-imports.sh` (new) |
| TU-7  | 🔵  | ✅ Done | Add `setup_test_schema(schema_json: &str) -> CompiledSchema` to `fraiseql-test-utils` — compiles a schema string for use in unit tests that need a `CompiledSchema` without a real file | `crates/fraiseql-test-utils/src/schema.rs` (new) |
| TU-8  | 🔵  | ✅ Done | Add `assert_graphql_error_code(response, code)` and `assert_field_path(response, path, value)` helpers — currently tests inline these comparisons verbosely | `crates/fraiseql-test-utils/src/assertions.rs` |
| TU-9  | 🔵  | ✅ Done | Add `fraiseql-test-utils` to the test-quality-standards infrastructure doc from Campaign 2 — all new tests must import shared helpers before rolling their own | `infrastructure/test-utility-adoption-policy.md` (new) |

See `batches/batch-1-test-utility.md` for the exact helper signatures and
migration checklist.

## BATCH 2 — Error path coverage

**Risk**: `compile()` has four internal error paths (parser, validator,
lowering, codegen) with zero failing-input tests. A refactor that silently
changes error types or messages will not be caught. Database adapters have
no tests for connection failure, query timeout, or response parsing errors —
the most common production failure modes.

**Requires**: TU-7 recommended first (tests use `setup_test_schema`).

| ID    | Sev | Status | What | Where |
|-------|-----|--------|------|-------|
| EP-1  | 🟠  |        | Add compiler parse-error tests: invalid JSON, missing `types` key, `types` not an array, field with no `name` key — each must return `FraiseQLError::Parse` | `crates/fraiseql-core/src/compiler/mod.rs` (in-module tests) |
| EP-2  | 🟠  |        | Add compiler validation-error tests: circular type reference (`A → B → A`), self-referencing type without `@list`, unknown field type — each must return `FraiseQLError::Validation` | `crates/fraiseql-core/src/compiler/mod.rs` (in-module tests) |
| EP-3  | 🟡  |        | Add compiler lowering-error tests: query referencing undefined type, mutation with missing `sql_source` — must return `FraiseQLError::Validation` with field path | `crates/fraiseql-core/tests/compiler_error_paths.rs` (new) |
| EP-4  | 🟡  |        | Add compiler codegen-error tests: unsupported GraphQL directive combination — must return `FraiseQLError::Unsupported` with feature name | `crates/fraiseql-core/tests/compiler_error_paths.rs` (new, same file as EP-3) |
| EP-5  | 🟠  |        | Add PostgreSQL adapter tests for connection failure: inject a `MockPool` that returns `PoolError` on `get()`; call `execute_query` and `execute_mutation`; assert `FraiseQLError::ConnectionPool` | `crates/fraiseql-core/src/db/postgres/adapter.rs` (in-module tests) |
| EP-6  | 🟡  |        | Add MySQL adapter tests for the same failure modes as EP-5 | `crates/fraiseql-core/src/db/mysql/adapter.rs` (in-module tests) |
| EP-7  | 🟡  |        | Add SQLite adapter tests: confirm that `execute_function_call` returns `FraiseQLError::Unsupported` (this was a bug in Campaign 1; test the fix stays fixed) | `crates/fraiseql-core/src/db/sqlite/adapter.rs` (in-module tests) |
| EP-8  | 🟡  |        | Add validator error-branch tests for the 10 highest-traffic validators in `fraiseql-core/src/validation/`: email, phone, url, uuid, date, integer range, string length, regex pattern, enum membership, required field — each must emit a `ValidationError` with the correct field path | `crates/fraiseql-core/tests/validation_error_paths.rs` (new) |

See `batches/batch-2-error-coverage.md` for MockPool design and the validator
error message contract.

---

## BATCH 3 — Property testing extension

**Risk**: `fraiseql-server` middleware (rate limiting with 11 bucket strategies,
auth header parsing, query complexity) and `fraiseql-observers` state machine
receive no generative test coverage. These are the components most likely to
encounter unexpected real-world input.

| ID    | Sev | Status | What | Where |
|-------|-----|--------|------|-------|
| PT-1  | 🟠  |        | Add property tests for rate-limit bucket key construction: arbitrary IP strings must never panic; key format must be stable under Unicode input, embedded colons, and empty strings | `crates/fraiseql-server/tests/property_rate_limiting.rs` (new) |
| PT-2  | 🟡  |        | Add property tests for auth header parsing: arbitrary `Authorization` header values must either parse successfully or return `FraiseQLError::Authentication` — must never panic | `crates/fraiseql-server/tests/property_auth_parsing.rs` (new) |
| PT-3  | 🟡  |        | Add property tests for query complexity calculation: arbitrary GraphQL query ASTs (generated by `proptest` strategies) must produce a non-negative complexity score; depth exceeding the limit must always return an error | `crates/fraiseql-server/tests/property_query_complexity.rs` (new) |
| PT-4  | 🟡  |        | Add property tests for observer state machine transitions: from any valid state, only the documented next states must be reachable; invalid transitions must return an error, never panic | `crates/fraiseql-observers/tests/property_state_machine.rs` (new) |
| PT-5  | 🔵  |        | Add property tests for cascade invalidation: arbitrary sets of mutation-to-view mappings must produce invalidation sets that are a superset of direct dependants and a subset of all views — no over-invalidation, no under-invalidation | `crates/fraiseql-core/tests/property_cache_invalidation.rs` (new) |

See `batches/batch-3-property-testing.md` for `proptest` strategy definitions
and the state machine transition table.

## BATCH 4 — Arrow Flight completeness

**Risk**: `execute_placeholder_query` is imported into the live service code
path in `service.rs:545`. A request that triggers the `None` branch for the
database adapter (development/testing mode) silently returns placeholder data
in production if misconfigured. Three `Status::unimplemented()` stubs in
`handlers.rs` are undocumented in any issue tracker, meaning they are invisible
to users who discover them only at runtime.

| ID    | Sev | Status | What | Where |
|-------|-----|--------|------|-------|
| AF-1  | 🟠  |        | Guard `execute_placeholder_query` behind `#[cfg(test)]` or a `testing` feature flag — production service must not be able to call it; add a compile-time assertion | `crates/fraiseql-arrow/src/flight_server/convert.rs:218`, `service.rs:545` |
| AF-2  | 🟠  |        | Implement `do_get` for `BulkExport` command or return a documented `Status::unimplemented` with a link to the tracking issue in the error message (currently the message is `"BulkExport not implemented yet"` with no context) | `crates/fraiseql-arrow/src/flight_server/handlers.rs:226` |
| AF-3  | 🟠  |        | Implement `do_put` for `BulkExport` command — same as AF-2 | `crates/fraiseql-arrow/src/flight_server/handlers.rs:1087` |
| AF-4  | 🟡  |        | Implement `poll_flight_info` or replace the stub with a structured `Status::unimplemented` that names the missing feature and version target | `crates/fraiseql-arrow/src/flight_server/handlers.rs:1130` |
| AF-5  | 🔵  |        | Add integration tests for the implemented Arrow Flight commands (`do_get`/`do_put` for the non-BulkExport path) — currently the flight server has zero integration tests | `crates/fraiseql-arrow/tests/flight_integration.rs` (new) |

See `batches/batch-4-arrow-flight.md` for the BulkExport protocol design and
the `#[cfg(test)]` guard pattern.

## BATCH 5 — Core split prerequisite work

**Risk**: CA-1 and CA-2 from Campaign 2 remain blocked by two concrete coupling
points. Without resolving them, `fraiseql-core` will reach the 150K-line split
threshold with no clear migration path. This batch resolves the coupling so the
splits from Campaign 2 can actually land.

**Requires**: All other batches recommended first (reduces surface area before
restructuring).

| ID    | Sev | Status | What | Where |
|-------|-----|--------|------|-------|
| CS-1  | 🟡  |        | Relocate `compiler::aggregation::OrderByClause` and `schema::SqlProjectionHint` to a new `crates/fraiseql-core/src/types/sql_hints.rs` module — removes the import that blocks `fraiseql-db` extraction (CA-1 blocker) | `crates/fraiseql-core/src/compiler/aggregation.rs`, `schema/compiled.rs` |
| CS-2  | 🟡  |        | Introduce `ExecutorAdapter` trait in `crates/fraiseql-core/src/cache/adapter/mod.rs` that `runtime/executor/` implements — removes the direct type import that creates the circular dependency blocking CA-2 | `crates/fraiseql-core/src/cache/adapter/mod.rs`, `runtime/executor/mod.rs` |
| CS-3  | 🟡  |        | Extract `crates/fraiseql-core/src/db/` into `crates/fraiseql-db/` — unblocked after CS-1; update `fraiseql-core/Cargo.toml` to depend on `fraiseql-db` | New crate `crates/fraiseql-db/` (resolves CA-1) |
| CS-4  | 🟡  |        | Extract `crates/fraiseql-core/src/runtime/executor/` into `crates/fraiseql-executor/` — unblocked after CS-2; update `fraiseql-core/Cargo.toml` to depend on `fraiseql-executor` | New crate `crates/fraiseql-executor/` (resolves CA-2) |

See `batches/batch-5-core-split.md` for the full dependency graph analysis,
migration steps, and the `ExecutorAdapter` trait design.

## Infrastructure

| ID    | Priority | What | Document |
|-------|----------|------|----------|
| INF-1 | 🟠 High  | Test utility adoption policy — mandate `fraiseql-test-utils` for all new integration tests; ban bare `std::env::var("DATABASE_URL")` in test files | `infrastructure/test-utility-adoption-policy.md` |
