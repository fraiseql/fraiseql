# Agent Task: Fix Pre-commit.ci UV Dependency Issue

## Problem Statement
The FraiseQL repository's pre-commit.ci pipeline is failing with the error "uv not found - cannot run tests!" when processing pull requests. This is blocking the pre-commit hook execution and preventing automated code quality checks.

## Background Context
- FraiseQL is a Python GraphQL framework repository on GitHub
- The repository uses pre-commit.ci for automated code quality checks
- Recent PRs are failing pre-commit.ci checks due to missing `uv` (Universal Python package installer)
- All other CI checks (GitHub Actions: Lint, Security, Tests, Quality Gate) are passing
- The issue is specifically with pre-commit.ci environment configuration

## Technical Requirements

### Primary Objective
Fix the pre-commit.ci configuration to ensure the `uv` package manager is available for test execution.

### Specific Tasks
1. **Investigate current pre-commit configuration**:
   - Examine `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
   - Check if there are any hooks that depend on `uv`
   - Identify which hook is failing (likely a pytest-related hook)

2. **Implement solution**:
   - Either add `uv` installation to pre-commit.ci environment
   - Or modify the problematic hook to use standard Python tools instead of `uv`
   - Ensure the fix doesn't break local development workflows

3. **Validate the fix**:
   - Test the configuration locally if possible
   - Ensure pre-commit hooks can run without `uv` dependency issues
   - Verify backward compatibility with existing development setup

## Constraints and Considerations

### What NOT to change
- Don't modify core application code or tests
- Don't change the Python package management for the main project
- Preserve existing local development workflows using `uv`
- Maintain all existing pre-commit hook functionality

### Technical Guidelines
- Follow FraiseQL repository conventions
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the CI issue
- Document any configuration changes made
- Consider both local development and CI environments

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Fixed pre-commit configuration** that works in pre-commit.ci environment
2. **Documentation** of what was changed and why
3. **Testing verification** that hooks can run successfully
4. **Preserve existing functionality** for local development

## Context Files to Examine
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Main pre-commit configuration
- `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` - Project dependencies
- Any CI/CD configuration files
- README or development setup documentation

## Success Criteria
- Pre-commit.ci checks pass on new PRs
- Local pre-commit hooks continue to work as expected
- No disruption to existing development workflows
- Clear documentation of changes made

## Additional Notes
- This is a CI/CD infrastructure fix, not a feature development task
- The goal is to unblock PR reviews by fixing the automated quality checks
- Consider if this is a temporary workaround or permanent solution
- Look for similar issues in other Python projects using pre-commit.ci + uv
