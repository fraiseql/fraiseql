## 🎯 Critical Success Factors

### Must-Haves
1. ✅ **Phase 1 complete** (navigation fixed)
2. ✅ **Phase 2 complete** (API reference, benchmarks, deployment)
3. ⚠️ **At least 2 video tutorials** (quickstart + architecture)
4. ⚠️ **Production deployment templates** that work
5. ⚠️ **Community platform** active with moderation

### Nice-to-Haves
- Interactive examples (enhance learning but not critical)
- All 6 phases complete (can be phased)
- Conference talks (credibility but takes time)
- VS Code extension (great DX but not essential)

### Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Too ambitious, never completes
**Mitigation**: Phased approach, prioritize Phases 1-3

**Risk**: Poor quality from rushing
**Mitigation**: User testing at each phase

**Risk**: No ongoing maintenance
**Mitigation**: Build community early (Phase 6)

**Risk**: Low adoption despite great docs
**Mitigation**: Marketing, testimonials, case studies

## 🎓 Lessons & Best Practices

### What Worked in Phase 1

1. ✅ **Replace placeholders immediately** - Users judge quickly
2. ✅ **Organize internal docs** - Reduces clutter
3. ✅ **Standardize prerequisites** - Consistency matters
4. ✅ **Prominent core concepts** - Help users understand mental model
5. ✅ **Quick wins first** - Build momentum

### Recommendations for Future Phases

1. **Test with real users** - Don't assume documentation is clear
2. **Keep examples updated** - Broken examples destroy trust
3. **Link everything** - Make navigation effortless
4. **Show, don't tell** - Code examples > explanations
5. **Admit gaps** - "Coming soon" better than silence if honest
6. **Measure everything** - Track what users actually use
7. **Iterate fast** - Release documentation changes immediately
8. **Build community early** - They'll help with examples and support
