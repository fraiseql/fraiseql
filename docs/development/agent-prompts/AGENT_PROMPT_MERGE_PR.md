# Agent Prompt: Merge NetworkOperatorStrategy Fix PR

## Context
A comprehensive fix for FraiseQL v0.5.5 network filtering issues has been implemented and committed to PR #27 (`fix/network-operator-eq-support`). The fix resolves the "Unsupported network operator: eq" error by adding basic comparison operators to NetworkOperatorStrategy.

## Your Mission
Check PR #27 status, squash/rebase if needed, and merge into dev branch if all GitHub QC checks pass.

## PR Details

- **Branch**: `fix/network-operator-eq-support`
- **PR Number**: #27
- **Target Branch**: `dev`
- **Title**: "fix: Add basic comparison operators to NetworkOperatorStrategy"

## What Was Fixed

- Added `eq`, `neq`, `in`, `notin` operators to NetworkOperatorStrategy
- Fixed IP address equality filtering: `{ ipAddress: { eq: "8.8.8.8" } }`
- Proper PostgreSQL `::inet` type casting in generated SQL
- Comprehensive test coverage (19 passing tests)
- Verified no other operator strategies need similar fixes

## Tasks to Complete

### 1. Check PR Status
```bash
gh pr view 27 --json state,statusCheckRollupState,mergeable
```

### 2. Verify GitHub QC Status
Confirm all checks pass:

- âœ… GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- âœ… All tests passing
- âœ… Code quality checks
- âœ… No merge conflicts

### 3. Review PR if Needed
```bash
gh pr diff 27
gh pr checks 27
```

### 4. Squash and Merge (if QC passes)
```bash
# Option A: GitHub CLI merge with squash
gh pr merge 27 --squash --delete-branch

# Option B: Manual squash if needed
git checkout fix/network-operator-eq-support
git rebase -i dev  # Squash commits if multiple
git checkout dev
git merge fix/network-operator-eq-support --ff-only
git push origin dev
git branch -d fix/network-operator-eq-support
git push origin --delete fix/network-operator-eq-support
```

### 5. Post-Merge Verification
```bash
# Confirm merge completed
git log --oneline -5
git branch -a | grep network-operator  # Should show no local/remote branches

# Run quick test to verify fix works
pytest tests/unit/sql/test_network_operator_strategy_fix.py -v
```

## Expected Commit Message (if squashing)
```
fix: Add basic comparison operators to NetworkOperatorStrategy

- Add eq, neq, in, notin operators to support IP address equality filtering
- Fix "Unsupported network operator: eq" error in FraiseQL v0.5.5
- Generate proper PostgreSQL ::inet casting in SQL output
- Add comprehensive test coverage (19 tests)
- Verify other operator strategies don't need similar fixes

Resolves IP filtering issues:

- ipAddress: { eq: "8.8.8.8" } now works correctly
- ipAddress: { in: ["8.8.8.8", "1.1.1.1"] } now works correctly
- Maintains backward compatibility with network-specific operators

## Failure Scenarios

### If GitHub QC Fails

1. Check specific failure: `gh pr checks 27`
2. DO NOT merge - report the failure details
3. Leave PR open for fixes

### If Merge Conflicts

1. Check conflict details: `gh pr view 27`
2. DO NOT auto-resolve - report conflicts need manual resolution
3. Suggest rebase strategy if appropriate

### If PR Not Ready

1. Report current status
2. DO NOT force merge
3. Wait for all checks to complete

## Success Criteria

- [x] All GitHub QC checks passing
- [x] PR successfully merged into dev branch
- [x] Feature branch deleted (local and remote)
- [x] Post-merge tests confirm fix works
- [x] Clean git history (squashed commits if multiple)

## Important Notes

- **Target branch**: `dev` (not `main`)
- **Squash preferred**: Multiple commits should be squashed into single commit
- **Test after merge**: Run the NetworkOperatorStrategy tests to confirm
- **Delete branches**: Clean up feature branch after successful merge

## Context Files for Reference

- `src/fraiseql/sql/operator_strategies.py` - Main fix implementation
- `tests/unit/sql/test_network_operator_strategy_fix.py` - Primary test suite
- `tests/unit/sql/test_all_operator_strategies_coverage.py` - Comprehensive verification
- `../fixes/NETWORK_OPERATOR_FIX.md` - Complete technical documentation

## Expected Outcome
After successful completion, the FraiseQL v0.5.5 network filtering issues will be fully resolved in the dev branch, ready for the next release.
