# FraiseQL Cleanup & Clarification - COMPLEX

**Complexity**: Complex | **Phased Documentation Approach**

## Executive Summary

Transform FraiseQL from a confusing multi-version repository into a clear, accessible project with unified documentation, explicit version guidance, and progressive learning paths. Addresses 10 critical confusion points identified through new user onboarding analysis.

**Goal**: Enable new users to understand project structure, choose the right version, and get productive within 30 minutes.

## PHASES

### Phase 1: Version Clarity & Project Structure

**Objective**: Eliminate confusion about multiple versions (root, fraiseql/, fraiseql_rs/, fraiseql-v1/) and document clear project structure.

1. **IDENTIFY**: Document what's confusing
   - Multiple README files without clear hierarchy
   - 4 different implementations (root, fraiseql/, fraiseql_rs/, fraiseql-v1/)
   - No clear "what to use" guidance
   - Directory purposes unclear (archive/, benchmark_submission/, etc.)

2. **CREATE**: Minimal viable documentation
   - Create `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` explaining all directories
   - Add version status table to main README
   - Create navigation section at top of main README
   - Add clear "Which version should I use?" section

3. **REFACTOR**: Improve clarity and organization
   - Consolidate version information into single source of truth
   - Add visual diagrams for project structure
   - Cross-reference between version docs

## Implementation Notes

### Phased Execution Strategy

Execute phases sequentially to build on previous work:

1. **Phases 1-2** (Foundation): Structure + Navigation - enables all other work
2. **Phases 3-4** (Education): Concepts + Installation - reduces friction
3. **Phases 5-6** (Guidance): Examples + Performance - sets expectations
4. **Phases 7-9** (Alignment): Quickstart + Versions + Audience - removes confusion
5. **Phase 10** (Quality): Testing - ensures everything works

### Testing Approach

For documentation tasks, testing means:
- **Link validation**: All internal/external links work
- **Code execution**: All examples run successfully
- **User testing**: Can a new user complete tasks in stated time?
- **Consistency**: No contradictory information

### Maintenance Strategy

After cleanup, maintain quality through:
- Documentation linting in CI
- Link checking automated
- Example testing in CI
- Version status updates with each release
- Quarterly user onboarding audits

## Agent Execution Instructions

When executing this plan as an autonomous agent:

1. **Start with Phase 1** - foundation is critical
2. **Complete full cycle before moving** - don't skip REFACTOR or QA
3. **Create artifacts** - all files listed in "Files to create/modify"
4. **Check success metrics** - verify each phase's metrics before proceeding
5. **Cross-reference** - ensure new docs link to related docs
6. **Maintain consistency** - use same terminology across all docs
7. **Test everything** - if you write code, run it
8. **Document decisions** - explain why you chose certain approaches
9. **Update this plan** - mark phases complete, note deviations
10. **Final verification** - Phase 10 is mandatory, don't skip

### Agent Checklist Per Phase

- [ ] Read all related existing docs first
- [ ] Identify specific confusion points (concrete examples)
- [ ] Create minimal documentation that addresses confusion
- [ ] Refactor for clarity (add examples, visuals, cross-links)
- [ ] Test/verify (run code, check links, user simulation)
