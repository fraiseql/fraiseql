# Change-Log Contract — `core.tb_entity_change_log`

Contributor reference for the framework-owned change-log table: the **first step
of the Change Spine** (an app-mediated, transactional change-capture
foundation). FraiseQL ships the table, owns its schema, and — by default — the
mutation executor writes one row per state-changing mutation **inside the
mutation's own transaction**, so the change record is atomic with the change.

The column set is the **superset** of what perf-observability (#392) needs and
what the Change Spine envelope needs, so the table ships once and is never
re-migrated for either consumer.

---

## Design principles

1. **One owned contract, shipped once.** The superset of perf + envelope columns
   lives in a single framework migration. New consumers read existing columns;
   they do not add migrations.
2. **Atomic, in-transaction outbox.** The row is INSERTed on the same
   connection/transaction as the mutation function, before commit — exactly-once
   with the state change, never a lossy dual write.
3. **Two producer conformance levels.** The FraiseQL executor is one producer;
   any writer of contract-conforming rows (an ETL job, a sister service) is a
   first-class producer too.
4. **Additive, idempotent migration.** `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` +
   `ALTER … ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`. It never drops or renames a column. The
   one thing it *cannot* do is retype a pre-existing column — see
   [Upgrade & limitations](#upgrade--limitations).
5. **Single source of truth for the column set.** The typed contract
   [`fraiseql_observers::migrations::ENTITY_CHANGE_LOG_CONTRACT`] is what the
   migration DDL is checked against *and* what the `fraiseql doctor` drift check
   compares a live table against.

---

## The contract — superset column set

Placement: schema `core` (matches the existing reader and the
`03_add_nats_transport.sql` migration). DDL:
`crates/fraiseql-observers/migrations/08_create_entity_change_log_contract.sql`.

| Column | Type (PG) | `udt_name` | Source of need | Populated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pk_entity_change_log` | `BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PK` | `int8` | reader cursor | always |
| `id` | `UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()` | `uuid` | reader dedup / NATS id | always |
| `tenant_id` | `UUID` | `uuid` | RLS partition key (migration 12) + Trinity public id | executor |
| `fk_customer_org` | `BIGINT` | `int8` | internal join FK (Trinity `fk_{entity}`) | app / producer |
| `fk_contact` | `BIGINT` | `int8` | actor join FK | app / producer |
| `object_type` | `TEXT NOT NULL` | `text` | perf #392 + reader | executor |
| `modification_type` | `TEXT NOT NULL` | `text` | perf #392 + reader (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/CUSTOM) | executor |
| `object_id` | `UUID` | `uuid` | perf #392 + reader | executor |
| `object_data` | `JSONB` | `jsonb` | entity payload | executor |
| `updated_fields` | `TEXT[]` | `_text` | envelope (`MutationResponse.updated_fields`) | executor |
| `cascade` | `JSONB` | `jsonb` | envelope (graphql-cascade) | executor |
| `duration_ms` | `INTEGER` | `int4` | **perf #392** (slowest-mutation ordering) | executor (PG) |
| `started_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | `timestamptz` | **perf #392** (duration basis) | executor (PG) |
| `created_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()` | `timestamptz` | perf + reader | always |
| `commit_time` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | `timestamptz` | envelope (durable ordering) | executor |
| `seq` | `BIGINT` | `int8` | envelope (monotonic order; dedup on `(object_type, seq)`) | sequence default |
| `actor_type` | `TEXT` | `text` | **#390 actor model** (`human_user`/`service_account`/`ai_agent`/`system_job`) | executor (from `SecurityContext`) |
| `acting_for` | `UUID` | `uuid` | **#390 acting-on-behalf-of** (delegated human, public-facing UUID) | executor (from `SecurityContext`) |
| `schema_version` | `TEXT` | `text` | #377/#378 replay-correctness | executor (schema content hash) |
| `trace_id` | `TEXT` | `text` | perf #392 + #375 W3C trace | executor (from `traceparent`) |
| `trace_context` | `JSONB` | `jsonb` | #375 full W3C `traceparent`/`tracestate` | executor (parsed traceparent + tracestate) |
| `change_status` | `TEXT` | `text` | reader | app / producer |
| `extra_metadata` | `JSONB` | `jsonb` | reader + the `duration_calc_version` marker | executor |
| `nats_published_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | `timestamptz` | NATS bridge | bridge |
| `nats_event_id` | `UUID` | `uuid` | NATS dedup | bridge |

Indexes shipped: `idx_entity_log_duration (duration_ms DESC)` (slowest-mutation
forensics), `idx_entity_log_type (object_type)`, `idx_entity_log_created
(created_at)`, `idx_entity_log_tenant_seq (tenant_id, seq)`,
`idx_entity_log_type_seq (object_type, seq)`.

Read surface: the `core.v_entity_change_log` view exposes `duration_ms` + the
envelope columns top-level (indexed `WHERE`/`ORDER BY` for #392) and every
GraphQL field inside a `data` JSONB (keeps the #149 `entity_change_logs` query
stable).

---

## `tenant_id` vs `fk_customer_org` — complementary, not a rename

These are two distinct identifiers under the Trinity pattern. Never collapse
them:

- **`fk_customer_org`** — internal `BIGINT` foreign key, the Trinity `fk_{entity}`
  join slot. Kept as-is.
- **`tenant_id`** — the per-tenant partition key carried in the JWT →
  `SecurityContext`, a **UUID** (the public-facing identifier). It is the RLS
  partition key enforced by migration 12 (see "RLS / tenant isolation" below).
  Stamped *explicitly* at write time so out-of-session consumers (the change-log
  poller, the NATS bridge) re-authorize fan-out without reconstructing tenant
  identity
  from connection state — tenant identity is not portable across isolation
  models (PG `search_path` / MySQL current-DB / MSSQL `SESSION_CONTEXT`).

The executor parses `SecurityContext.tenant_id` with `Uuid::parse_str(…).ok()`;
a non-UUID tenant leaves the column `NULL` and **never** aborts the mutation —
the row is a log stamp, not the change itself.

So the contract is **purely additive**: `tenant_id` is added *alongside*
`fk_customer_org`, not in place of it.

---

## `seq` — a global sequence default

`seq` is fed by a plain global `SEQUENCE` set as the column `DEFAULT`
(`core.seq_entity_change_log`), not an executor-only counter. Any `INSERT` that
omits `seq` gets a monotonic value — the FraiseQL executor **and** cooperative
external producers alike. Durable ordering uses `seq`; dedup is on
`(object_type, seq)`.

---

## `duration_ms` — the canonical computation

`duration_ms` is **full wall-clock milliseconds** from `started_at` to the write,
on a single clock. The canonical expression lives in
[`fraiseql_db::changelog::duration_ms_sql`]:

```sql
(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (clock_timestamp() - current_setting('fraiseql.started_at')::timestamptz)) * 1000)::INTEGER
```

- **Both endpoints are on the DB clock** (`clock_timestamp()`). `started_at` is
  set transaction-locally via `set_config('fraiseql.started_at',
  clock_timestamp()::text, true)` before the mutation function runs, so there is
  no app↔DB clock skew. (`fraiseql_db::changelog::STARTED_AT_VAR` /
  `CLOCK_TIMESTAMP_DIRECTIVE`.)
- **`EXTRACT(EPOCH …)`, never `EXTRACT(MILLISECONDS …)`.** The
  `MILLISECONDS` form returns only *seconds-within-the-minute × 1000*, so it
  under-reports any interval ≥ 1 minute (`00:01:30.250` → `30250`, not `90250`).

### Data-quality marker (#392)

Each framework-written row stamps
`extra_metadata->>'duration_calc_version'` with
[`fraiseql_db::changelog::DURATION_CALC_VERSION`] = **`2`**: the
wall-clock-correct, single-DB-clock computation above. Legacy app-written rows
carry no marker (or `1`). #392's `null-rate` / forensics tooling uses the marker
to **refuse to mix incomparable rows** — pre-fix `EXTRACT(MILLISECONDS)` rows and
post-fix epoch rows must not be averaged together.

---

## Producer conformance levels

The contract owns the *schema + semantics*; the executor is one producer, and
external producers writing conforming rows are a first-class on-ramp to the
Spine.

### Full — the FraiseQL executor

Writes every request-scoped column: identity + change columns, `duration_ms`,
`started_at`, `commit_time`, `tenant_id`, `trace_id`, `schema_version`,
`trace_context`, `updated_fields`, `cascade`, and the `duration_calc_version`
marker. `schema_version` is the per-deployment constant — the compiled schema's
content hash — not a request value, so it is the same on every row this
deployment writes. On PostgreSQL the write is the in-transaction
`MATERIALIZED` CTE in the adapter
(`crates/fraiseql-db/src/postgres/adapter/database.rs`), prepared once and cached
(`prepare_cached`) so the per-mutation cost is dominated by index maintenance,
not statement re-parse.

**MySQL and SQL Server** write the same outbox row, but the portable way: they
cannot reference a `CALL`/`EXEC` result set in a following `INSERT … SELECT`, so
the adapter opens a transaction, runs the procedure, parses the
`app.mutation_response` row in Rust, and INSERTs the outbox row
([`build_changelog_insert_sql`]) on the same connection before commit — atomic
with the mutation (a raised procedure or a failed INSERT rolls back both). On
these two dialects `duration_ms` / `started_at` are legitimately **NULL** (no
request-scoped DB clock). Dialect notes the wiring surfaced:

- **MySQL** runs the `CALL` over sqlx's **binary** protocol (`sqlx::query`): the
  text-protocol `raw_sql` cannot form a `Send` future over a `&mut MySqlConnection`,
  which the connection-affine transaction requires. A binary `CALL` result set's
  columns are addressable only **by ordinal**, not by name.
- **SQL Server** wraps the work in `SET XACT_ABORT ON; BEGIN TRAN … COMMIT`, so any
  runtime error dooms and rolls back the whole transaction (and leaves no open
  transaction on the pooled connection).
- The portable INSERT **quotes column identifiers per dialect** (`` `cascade` `` /
  `[cascade]` / `"cascade"`) because `cascade` is a reserved keyword in MySQL and
  SQL Server.

### Cooperative external producer (ETL / jobs / sister services)

Supplies the identity + change columns it can know by value — `object_type`,
`modification_type`, `object_id`, `tenant_id`, `object_data`,
`updated_fields`, `cascade` — and lets the table's `seq` default fire. The
portable, fully-parameterized INSERT for non-PostgreSQL dialects is
[`fraiseql_db::changelog::build_changelog_insert_sql`] over
[`fraiseql_db::changelog::CHANGELOG_PORTABLE_INSERT_COLUMNS`].

For these rows **`duration_ms` and `started_at` are legitimately `NULL`** —
there is no FraiseQL request context to measure. This is expected, not
drift; #392's `null-rate` subcommand exists to measure exactly this population.

---

## Opt-out

The write is on by default. Two levels, AND-composed by the runner:

- **Global** — `RuntimeConfig.changelog_enabled`, resolved from
  `FRAISEQL_CHANGELOG_ENABLED` (env) → `[changelog] write_enabled` (compiled
  schema, default `true`) → `true`.
- **Per-mutation** — `MutationDefinition.changelog` (compiled, serde-default
  `true`), authored as `@fraiseql.mutation(changelog=False)` (Python) or
  `@Mutation({ changelog: false })` (TypeScript). The decorators validate the
  value is a boolean and emit the key only when set, so a schema authored
  without it keeps logging.

`changelog_enabled && mutation_def.changelog` decides whether the row is written
for a given mutation.

---

## Ownership & migration (fix-forward)

FraiseQL **owns** `core.tb_entity_change_log`. A downstream app that previously
created its own version and INSERTed into it from mutation functions upgrades to
the framework-owned contract — a documented **breaking** change:

1. **The migration brings the table to the contract.** Additive + idempotent;
   `id`/`created_at` backfill from defaults, every other added column is
   nullable. It never drops or renames.
2. **The executor owns the write** (no compat flag). Apps **remove their
   hand-rolled inserts**. Cooperative external producers writing conforming rows
   remain first-class — a different, supported pattern, not a double write.
3. **The drift check (`fraiseql doctor`) reports reconciliation work** — see
   below.

### Upgrade & limitations

The migration is **additive**, so `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` **no-ops on a column
that already exists** and therefore **cannot retype or re-null it**. The
real-world hazard: a legacy app table with `object_id TEXT NOT NULL` is *not*
converted to the contract's `object_id UUID` (this bit the #149 change-log e2e).
The fix is a manual one-off:

```sql
ALTER TABLE core.tb_entity_change_log
    ALTER COLUMN object_id TYPE UUID USING object_id::uuid;
```

### Drift check (#380)

`fraiseql doctor --against-db postgres://…` reports drift between the live table
and the shipped contract, sourced from the same
`ENTITY_CHANGE_LOG_CONTRACT`:

- **Missing** contract column → warning; `fraiseql migrate up` adds it.
- **Type mismatch** on a pre-existing column → failure; the additive migration
  cannot fix it (e.g. a legacy `object_id text`) — `ALTER … TYPE` manually.
- **Extra** non-contract column → warning; left untouched (app-specific columns
  are safe to keep).

---

## RLS / tenant isolation (#437 F6 / #443)

`core.tb_entity_change_log` holds the full before/after payload for **every**
tenant. Migration `12_enable_change_log_rls.sql` turns on Row-Level Security so the
table is **fail-closed**: a database role that is neither the table owner nor
`BYPASSRLS`, and that has not set the `fraiseql.tenant_id` session GUC, reads
**zero** change-log rows.

- **Policies.** `ENABLE` (not `FORCE`) ROW LEVEL SECURITY; a SELECT policy
  `USING (tenant_id = NULLIF(current_setting('fraiseql.tenant_id', true), '')::uuid)`
  and a permissive `FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true)` (the executor outbox and the
  `SECURITY DEFINER` capture function are trusted to stamp the tenant; this never
  rejects an anonymous external-write capture).
- **What it enforces today vs. forward-looking.** FraiseQL does **not** set
  `fraiseql.tenant_id` on its read paths (row-mode tenancy uses WHERE-clause
  injection; schema-mode uses `SET search_path`). So the policy's *practical*
  effect today is **deny-by-default**: only trusted (`BYPASSRLS`/owner) roles read
  the change-log. The per-tenant `tenant_id = GUC` shape is forward-looking — a
  reader that sets the GUC sees exactly its own tenant — but no current code path
  does.
- **Least-privilege grants.** Migration 12 also `REVOKE ALL … FROM PUBLIC` on the
  table and both views, so the change-log is never world-readable. Grants are the
  *primary* control (only an explicitly granted trusted/`BYPASSRLS` role reads it);
  RLS is defence-in-depth on top, not the sole guard against a stray `GRANT`.
- **Views.** `core.v_entity_change_log` and `core.v_entity_change_log_debezium`
  are created with `security_invoker = true` (PostgreSQL 15+) **in the contract
  migration (08)** — born correct, not ALTER'd by a later migration — so they run as
  the *querying* role and honour the base-table RLS instead of bypassing it as the
  view owner. On PostgreSQL < 15 the option does not exist: 08 warns, the views stay
  owner-run, and they must be protected by restricting `SELECT` to trusted roles. (A
  reader of the views under `security_invoker` also needs `SELECT` on the underlying
  table.)
- **Capture under RLS.** The capture function `core.fn_entity_change_log_capture()`
  is `SECURITY DEFINER` with a pinned `search_path = pg_catalog, core` (migration
  11), so an uncooperative external write still produces a change-log row — the
  function runs as the table owner, exempt under `ENABLE`.
- **`fraiseql doctor` check.** `fraiseql doctor --against-db <url>` warns when RLS
  is enabled on the change-log but the connecting role is neither the table owner nor
  `BYPASSRLS` — catching the silent-empty-pipeline footgun (below) before it bites.

### Operator action (BREAKING)

The trusted cross-tenant consumers — the change-log poller, the three NATS bridges,
the server changelog HTTP handlers, and the mutation executor's outbox INSERT — run
on the server's database role. That role **must** be the table owner or carry
`BYPASSRLS`, otherwise the CDC pipeline and the admin change-log query silently
return an empty result. The `fraiseql perf` CLI reader connects with the operator's
own role; grant it `BYPASSRLS` or run it as a tenant with `fraiseql.tenant_id` set.

> CI's `fraiseql_test` superuser bypasses RLS automatically, which is why the
> isolation test (`crates/fraiseql-observers/tests/rls_isolation.rs`) runs its
> assertions under a dedicated `NOBYPASSRLS` role — a superuser would mask the
> policy entirely. MySQL / SQL Server change-log isolation is a tracked follow-up.

---

## This is the Change Spine first step — consumer map

- **#392 perf-observability** — the first consumer, **shipped** as the
  `fraiseql perf` CLI command group. Reads `duration_ms` via
  `v_entity_change_log`; the `duration_calc_version` marker gates pre/post-fix
  mixing. `perf regression-scan` flags per-`(object_type, modification_type)`
  latency regressions between a baseline and a recent window; `perf explore
  slowest | null-rate | summary` are ad-hoc forensic reads. See
  [perf-observability seam](#perf-observability-seam-392) for the orchestration
  contract.
- **#382 CDC broker fan-out** — drains this executor-written outbox
  (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`); no WAL needed.
- **#374 multi-DB parity** — the outbox is a plain INSERT → portable across
  PG/MySQL/SQLite/MSSQL.
- **#366 external-write capture** — a shipped, suppressible PL/pgSQL fallback
  trigger (`core.fn_entity_change_log_capture`) writes a contract-conforming row
  for an *uncooperative external write* (raw psql / migration / third-party tool)
  only when the executor's transaction-local `fraiseql.cdc_mediated` marker is
  absent, so app-path writes are never double-captured. No `wal_level=logical`, no
  slots. See [external-write-capture.md](./external-write-capture.md).
- **Observer fan-out** (NATS subscribers, the deduped executor's `TenantScope`,
  search / Arrow sinks) — the change-log poller projects `tenant_id` (the
  public-facing UUID partition stamp), `duration_ms` and `seq` top-level onto the
  `EntityEvent` it emits, so tenant filtering keys off the UUID `tenant_id` (not
  the internal `fk_customer_org` BIGINT) and consumers see the perf / ordering
  metadata, not just the GraphQL `data` JSONB.
- **#375 OpenTelemetry** — **fully populated**: the executor stamps both the
  scalar `trace_id` (the inbound `traceparent`'s 32-hex trace-id, the #392 `perf
  explore slowest` / regression investigation handle) **and** the full
  `trace_context` JSONB — the parsed `traceparent`
  (`{version, trace_id, parent_id, trace_flags}`) plus the `tracestate` header
  when present — so a change-log row carries enough to re-propagate / reconstruct
  the distributed trace, not just link to it. Both are parsed from the request
  headers onto the `SecurityContext` and written on every dialect (`trace_context`
  as JSONB on PostgreSQL, JSON / `NVARCHAR(MAX)` on MySQL / SQL Server); both are
  NULL for a request with no valid trace context, never aborting the mutation.
- **#377/#378 schema versioning / zero-downtime replay** — the `schema_version`
  column is **populated**: the executor stamps the compiled schema's content hash
  (`CompiledSchema::content_hash()`, a per-deployment constant precomputed once on
  the `ExecutorContext`) on every outbox row, on every dialect, so a row records
  which deployment produced it. #378 (DLQ replay / zero-downtime deploys) reads it
  to reject a row replayed under a different schema rather than corrupt data. It is
  the same content hash that keys the query cache, the `/health` schema digest, and
  hot-reload diffing — so it changes on **any** schema change.
- **#390 actor model** (`actor_type` / `acting_for`): the executor stamps the
  request's actor classification (`human_user` / `service_account` / `ai_agent` /
  `system_job`, derived onto the `SecurityContext` at authentication) and, for a
  delegated agent (RFC 8693 `act` claim), the underlying human's public-facing
  UUID. NULL only for an unauthenticated mutation (no `SecurityContext` to stamp)
  or a cooperative external producer. `acting_for` mirrors `tenant_id`'s UUID shape
  (a Trinity public id, **not** an internal `fk_*` BIGINT). The classification is
  *recorded* for forensics, not an authorization input. With these populated, no
  envelope column is NULL-by-design.

---

## perf-observability seam (#392)

`perf` is the *capability*; the `fraisier` orchestrator is the *scheduler*. The
boundary between them is a stable contract so a cadence runner can consume the
scan without parsing prose:

- **Exit code.** A successful scan exits **0 even when it finds regressions** — it
  is a report, not a gate. `--fail-on-regression` opts into exit **1** when any
  regression is found (for CI). Operational errors (unreachable DB, bad URL) exit
  non-zero via the normal CLI error path.
- **`--json`.** `regression-scan --json` emits a stable object — `findings[]`,
  `skipped[]`, and a `summary` (`groups_analyzed` / `regressions` /
  `total_samples` / `excluded_samples`). Each `explore` subcommand emits its own
  array / object. This is the machine-readable seam fraisier ingests.
- **Human output.** Each regression prints a `WARN ` line and each unevaluated
  group a `SKIP ` line — greppable severity markers for log-scraping setups.
- **Comparability.** Only rows carrying the current `duration_calc_version` enter
  the duration math, and latency is split per `(object_type, modification_type)`
  so a shift in the operation mix can never mask a regression as an improvement.

---

## Open follow-ups

The contract foundation is complete: the executor in-transaction write
(PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server), multi-DB portability, the reader projection
(the poller surfaces `tenant_id` / `duration_ms` / `seq` top-level on the
`EntityEvent`), the SDK `changelog=False` opt-out, the `doctor` drift check, and
the #390 actor-model stamp (`actor_type` / `acting_for`) have all shipped. No
tracked follow-ups remain for the contract itself; new work arrives via its
downstream consumers (#392 / #382 / #374 / #377 / #375).

The **broader #390 surface** — beyond the audit/change-log stamp this slice
delivers — remains follow-up work: the RBAC policy DSL gaining `actor_type`
predicates, per-`(tenant, actor_type)` rate-limit budgets, and a durable
Postgres-backed tenant audit log (only the in-memory log exists today).

## Anchor paths

- Contract DDL: `crates/fraiseql-observers/migrations/08_create_entity_change_log_contract.sql`
  (MySQL `09_*`, MSSQL `10_*`).
- Column set (single source of truth): `fraiseql_observers::migrations::ENTITY_CHANGE_LOG_CONTRACT`
  (+ `entity_change_log_contract_sql()`).
- `duration_ms` + markers: `fraiseql_db::changelog` (`duration_ms_sql`,
  `STARTED_AT_VAR`, `DURATION_CALC_VERSION`).
- Portable INSERT: `fraiseql_db::changelog::{build_changelog_insert_sql, CHANGELOG_PORTABLE_INSERT_COLUMNS}`.
- Executor in-txn write: `crates/fraiseql-db/src/postgres/adapter/database.rs`.
- Reader / poller: `crates/fraiseql-observers/src/listener/change_log.rs`.
- Drift check: `crates/fraiseql-cli/src/commands/doctor.rs` (`fraiseql doctor --against-db`).
- perf-observability (#392): `crates/fraiseql-cli/src/commands/perf/` (`reader.rs`
  reads `core.v_entity_change_log`; `analysis.rs` holds the pure, unit-tested
  regression / slowest / null-rate / summary logic).
- Related: [`mutation-response.md`](./mutation-response.md) — the row the executor parses to fill the envelope.
