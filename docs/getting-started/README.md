# Getting Started

Welcome! This directory contains everything you need to go from zero to building your first FraiseQL application.

## Learning Path

Follow this recommended progression:

### 1. **[Installation](installation.md)** 🔧

Get FraiseQL installed and running on your system.

**Time**: 10 minutes
**You'll learn**: System requirements, installation options, troubleshooting

**Start here if**: You're new to FraiseQL or need to set up your environment

---

### 2. **[Quickstart (5 minutes)](quickstart.md)** 🚀

Get a working GraphQL API running immediately.

**Time**: 5 minutes
**You'll build**: A simple note-taking API with queries and mutations
**You'll learn**:
- Installing FraiseQL
- Creating database views
- Defining GraphQL types
- Writing queries and mutations

**Start here if**: You want to see FraiseQL in action right now

---

### 3. **[First Hour Guide](first-hour.md)** 📚

Progressive tutorial building on the quickstart.

**Time**: 60 minutes
**You'll build**: Extended note-taking API with filtering, timestamps, and error handling
**You'll learn**:
- Adding fields and filtering
- Where input types and operators
- Mutation error handling patterns
- Production patterns (timestamps, triggers)

**Start here if**: You completed the quickstart and want to go deeper

## What You'll Build

By the end of these guides, you'll have:

- ✅ **Working GraphQL API** with queries and mutations
- ✅ **PostgreSQL integration** with automatic type inference
- ✅ **Type-safe operations** with full validation
- ✅ **Production patterns** for error handling and timestamps
- ✅ **Understanding** of FraiseQL's approach to database-driven GraphQL
