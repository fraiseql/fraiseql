# FraiseQL v0.5.7 - Advanced GraphQL Field Type Propagation

**Release Date:** September 1, 2025
**Version:** 0.5.7 (Minor Release)
**Previous Version:** 0.5.6

## 🚀 Major Enhancements

### GraphQL Field Type Propagation System
- **New**: Advanced GraphQL field type extraction and propagation to SQL operators
- **Enhancement**: Type-aware SQL generation for optimized database queries
- **Performance**: More efficient SQL with proper type casting based on GraphQL schema
- **Intelligence**: Automatic detection of IPAddress, DateTime, Port, and other special types

### CI/CD Infrastructure Improvements
- **Fixed**: Pre-commit.ci pipeline reliability with proper UV dependency handling
- **Enhanced**: Developer experience with faster, more reliable automated checks
- **Improved**: CI environment detection for seamless integration

## 🔧 Advanced Type-Aware Filtering

### Before v0.5.7 ✅ (Still Works)
```graphql
# Basic filtering worked but with generic SQL
dnsServers(where: { ipAddress: { eq: "8.8.8.8" } }) {
  id identifier ipAddress
}
```

### After v0.5.7 🚀 (Enhanced Performance)
```graphql
# Same GraphQL syntax but with optimized type-aware SQL generation
dnsServers(where: {
  ipAddress: { eq: "8.8.8.8" }        # → Optimized ::inet casting
  port: { gt: 1024 }                  # → Optimized ::integer casting
  createdAt: { gte: "2024-01-01" }    # → Optimized ::timestamp casting
}) {
  id identifier ipAddress port createdAt
}
```

## 🧠 Intelligent SQL Generation

### Type-Aware Operator Strategies
- **IPAddress fields**: Automatic `::inet` casting with network-aware operators
- **DateTime fields**: Automatic `::timestamp` casting with temporal operators
- **Port fields**: Automatic `::integer` casting with numeric operators
- **String fields**: Optimized text operations with proper collation
- **JSONB fields**: Enhanced JSON path operations with type hints

### SQL Quality Improvements
```sql
-- v0.5.6: Generic approach
(data->>'ip_address') = '8.8.8.8'

-- v0.5.7: Type-aware optimized SQL
(data->>'ip_address')::inet = '8.8.8.8'::inet
```
