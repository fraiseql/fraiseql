# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records documenting significant architectural decisions made during FraiseQL's development.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs document the **context, decision, and consequences** of architectural choices. They serve as:

- Historical record of "why" behind design decisions
- Reference for future architectural discussions
- Learning resource for new contributors
