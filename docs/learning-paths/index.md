## Quick Comparison

| Path | Best For | Prerequisites | Focus Areas |
|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **[Beginner](beginner.md)** | New to GraphQL | Basic SQL & Python | Fundamentals, first API |
| **[Backend](backend-developer.md)** | Database experts | PostgreSQL, API design | Performance, CQRS, production |
| **[Frontend](frontend-developer.md)** | API consumers | GraphQL clients | Queries, mutations, real-time |
| **[Migration](migrating.md)** | Existing projects | Current framework knowledge | Patterns, gradual adoption |

## Learning Approach

### üìö Progressive Learning
Each path follows a progressive structure:

1. **Foundation** - Core concepts and philosophy
2. **Hands-on** - Build something real
3. **Deep dive** - Advanced features
4. **Production** - Best practices and deployment

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimates

- **Quick win:** 30 minutes to first working API
- **Proficiency:** 2-3 hours to understand core concepts
- **Mastery:** 1-2 weeks of practice with real projects

### üéØ Learning Goals

After completing a learning path, you'll be able to:

‚úÖ **Design** database schemas optimized for GraphQL
‚úÖ **Build** type-safe APIs with FraiseQL
‚úÖ **Optimize** queries for production performance
‚úÖ **Deploy** APIs with confidence
‚úÖ **Debug** issues effectively
‚úÖ **Apply** best practices

## Self-Assessment

### Choose Beginner Path if you:

- Are new to GraphQL
- Want to understand FraiseQL from scratch
- Prefer step-by-step guidance
- Have 2-3 hours to invest

### Choose Backend Path if you:

- Know PostgreSQL well
- Want to leverage database features
- Care about performance optimization
- Design database schemas regularly

### Choose Frontend Path if you:

- Consume GraphQL APIs
- Work with React, Vue, or other frameworks
- Want to optimize client-side performance
- Need real-time features

### Choose Migration Path if you:

- Have an existing GraphQL API
- Use Hasura, PostGraphile, or similar
- Want to migrate gradually
- Need to maintain compatibility

## Learning Resources

### üìñ Essential Reading

- [Core Concepts](../core-concepts/index.md) - Understand the philosophy
- [API Reference](../api-reference/index.md) - Complete API documentation
- [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) - Hands-on examples

### üõ†Ô∏è Practice Projects

1. **Todo API** - Simple CRUD (30 min)
2. **Blog Platform** - Relationships (1 hour)
3. **E-commerce** - Complex queries (2 hours)
4. **Real-time Chat** - Subscriptions (2 hours)

### üí¨ Getting Help

- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/fraiseql/fraiseql/discussions) - Community help
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/fraiseql/fraiseql/issues) - Bug reports
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/fraiseql) - Q&A

## Success Tips

### üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Pick one path** - Don't try to learn everything at once
2. **Follow the order** - Paths are carefully structured
3. **Run the examples** - Hands-on practice is essential
4. **Take breaks** - Let concepts sink in

### üìà Leveling Up

1. **Build projects** - Apply what you learn
2. **Read the source** - FraiseQL is open source
3. **Join the community** - Learn from others
4. **Share knowledge** - Teaching reinforces learning

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

- **Skipping prerequisites** - Foundation matters
- **Not running examples** - Theory isn't enough
- **Over-engineering** - Start simple, iterate
- **Ignoring errors** - Error messages are helpful

## Path Completion

### What Counts as "Complete"?
A path is complete when you can:

- Explain FraiseQL's core concepts
- Build a working API from scratch
- Debug common issues
- Apply best practices

### Next Steps After Completion

1. **Build a real project** - Apply your knowledge
2. **Try another path** - Broaden your perspective
3. **Explore advanced topics** - Go deeper
4. **Contribute** - Help improve FraiseQL
