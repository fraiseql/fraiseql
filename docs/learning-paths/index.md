## Quick Comparison

| Path | Best For | Prerequisites | Focus Areas |
|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **[Beginner](beginner.md)** | New to GraphQL | Basic SQL & Python | Fundamentals, first API |
| **[Backend](backend-developer.md)** | Database experts | PostgreSQL, API design | Performance, CQRS, production |
| **[Frontend](frontend-developer.md)** | API consumers | GraphQL clients | Queries, mutations, real-time |
| **[Migration](migrating.md)** | Existing projects | Current framework knowledge | Patterns, gradual adoption |

## Learning Approach

### 📚 Progressive Learning
Each path follows a progressive structure:

1. **Foundation** - Core concepts and philosophy
2. **Hands-on** - Build something real
3. **Deep dive** - Advanced features
4. **Production** - Best practices and deployment

### ⏱️ Time Estimates

- **Quick win:** 30 minutes to first working API
- **Proficiency:** 2-3 hours to understand core concepts
- **Mastery:** 1-2 weeks of practice with real projects

### 🎯 Learning Goals

After completing a learning path, you'll be able to:

✅ **Design** database schemas optimized for GraphQL
✅ **Build** type-safe APIs with FraiseQL
✅ **Optimize** queries for production performance
✅ **Deploy** APIs with confidence
✅ **Debug** issues effectively
✅ **Apply** best practices

## Self-Assessment

### Choose Beginner Path if you:

- Are new to GraphQL
- Want to understand FraiseQL from scratch
- Prefer step-by-step guidance
- Have 2-3 hours to invest

### Choose Backend Path if you:

- Know PostgreSQL well
- Want to leverage database features
- Care about performance optimization
- Design database schemas regularly

### Choose Frontend Path if you:

## Success Tips

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Pick one path** - Don't try to learn everything at once
2. **Follow the order** - Paths are carefully structured
3. **Run the examples** - Hands-on practice is essential
4. **Take breaks** - Let concepts sink in

### 📈 Leveling Up

1. **Build projects** - Apply what you learn
2. **Read the source** - FraiseQL is open source
3. **Join the community** - Learn from others
4. **Share knowledge** - Teaching reinforces learning

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- **Skipping prerequisites** - Foundation matters
- **Not running examples** - Theory isn't enough
- **Over-engineering** - Start simple, iterate
- **Ignoring errors** - Error messages are helpful

## Path Completion

### What Counts as "Complete"?
A path is complete when you can:

- Explain FraiseQL's core concepts
- Build a working API from scratch
- Debug common issues
- Apply best practices

### Next Steps After Completion

1. **Build a real project** - Apply your knowledge
2. **Try another path** - Broaden your perspective
3. **Explore advanced topics** - Go deeper
4. **Contribute** - Help improve FraiseQL

## Quick Start by Role

### "I'm a Full-Stack Developer"
→ Start with [Beginner Path](beginner.md), then choose backend or frontend based on interest
