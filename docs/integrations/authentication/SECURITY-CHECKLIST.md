## Incident Response

### If Breach Occurs

1. **Immediate (0-1 hour)**
   - [ ] Revoke all active sessions
   - [ ] Force password reset for affected users
   - [ ] Enable MFA for admin accounts
   - [ ] Preserve evidence (logs, memory dumps)

2. **Short term (1-24 hours)**
   - [ ] Notify security team
   - [ ] Assess scope of breach
   - [ ] Communicate with users
   - [ ] Update OAuth provider

3. **Medium term (1-7 days)**
   - [ ] Complete forensic analysis
   - [ ] Root cause analysis
   - [ ] Patch vulnerabilities
   - [ ] Update security procedures

4. **Long term (1+ months)**
   - [ ] Notify compliance/legal
   - [ ] File incident report if required
   - [ ] Security audit
   - [ ] Implement preventive measures

### Testing Incident Response

```bash
# Simulate breach

1. Manually revoke all sessions
2. Verify users can't use old tokens
3. Verify users can log back in
4. Document time to recovery
5. Review logs for completeness
```
