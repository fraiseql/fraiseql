## 🔒 Quick Assessment

**Self-Assessment**: Before beginning, answer these questions:

- [ ] Do you have a security requirements document?
- [ ] Have you identified your compliance requirements (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.)?
- [ ] Is your organization's security team aware of this deployment?
- [ ] Do you have an incident response plan?

If you answered **no** to any of these, start with [Security Planning](#security-planning) section.
