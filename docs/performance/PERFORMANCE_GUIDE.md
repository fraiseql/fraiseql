---

## Performance Claims & Methodology

### Claim: "2-4x faster than traditional GraphQL frameworks"

**What this means**: FraiseQL is 2-4x faster than frameworks like Strawberry, Hasura, or PostGraphile for typical workloads, with end-to-end optimizations including APQ caching, field projection, and exclusive Rust pipeline transformation.

**Methodology**:
- **Baseline comparison**: Measured against Strawberry GraphQL (Python ORM) and Hasura (PostgreSQL GraphQL)
- **Test queries**: Simple user lookup, nested user+posts, filtered searches
- **Dataset**: 10k-100k records in PostgreSQL 15
- **Hardware**: Standard cloud instances (4 CPU, 8GB RAM)
- **Measurement**: End-to-end response time including database queries

**Realistic expectations**:
- **Simple queries** (single table): 2-3x faster
- **Complex queries** (joins, aggregations): 3-4x faster
- **Cached queries**: 4-10x faster (due to APQ optimization)
- **All queries**: Use exclusive Rust pipeline (PostgreSQL ‚Üí Rust ‚Üí HTTP)

**When this matters**: High-throughput APIs (>100 req/sec) where small latency improvements compound.

---

### Claim: "Sub-millisecond cached responses (0.5-2ms)"

**What this means**: Cached GraphQL queries return in 0.5-2ms when all optimization layers are active.

**Methodology**:
- **APQ caching**: SHA-256 hash lookup with PostgreSQL storage backend
- **Rust pipeline**: Direct database JSONB ‚Üí Rust transformation ‚Üí HTTP response (no Python string operations)
- **Field projection**: Optional filtering of requested GraphQL fields
- **Measurement**: Time from GraphQL request to HTTP response (excluding network latency)

**Realistic expectations**:
- **Cache hit**: 0.5-2ms (Rust pipeline + APQ)
- **Cache miss**: 5-25ms (includes database query)
- **Cache hit rate**: 85-95% in production applications

**Conditions**:
- PostgreSQL 15+ with proper indexing
- APQ storage backend configured (PostgreSQL recommended)
- Query complexity score < 100
- Response size < 50KB
- Exclusive Rust pipeline active (automatic in v0.11.5+)

---

### Claim: "85-95% cache hit rates in production applications"

**What this means**: Well-designed applications achieve 85-95% APQ cache hit rates with the exclusive Rust pipeline.

**Methodology**:
- **Client configuration**: Apollo Client with persisted queries enabled
- **Query patterns**: Stable query structure (no dynamic field selection)
- **Cache TTL**: 1-24 hours depending on data freshness requirements
- **Measurement**: Cache hits / (cache hits + cache misses) over 24-hour period

**Realistic expectations**:
- **Stable APIs**: 95%+ hit rate
- **Dynamic queries**: 80-90% hit rate
- **Admin interfaces**: 70-85% hit rate (more unique queries)

**Factors affecting hit rate**:
- Query stability (fewer unique queries = higher hit rate)
- Client-side query deduplication
- Cache TTL settings
- Query complexity (simple queries cache better)
- Rust pipeline compatibility (automatic)

---

### Claim: "0.05-0.5ms transform table responses"

**What this means**: Transform tables (`tv_*`) provide instant responses for complex queries, processed through the exclusive Rust pipeline.

**Methodology**:
- **Transform tables**: Pre-computed JSONB with generated columns
- **Comparison**: Traditional JOIN queries vs transform table lookups
- **Dataset**: 10k users with 50k posts (average 5 posts/user)
- **Measurement**: Database query time only (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)

**Realistic expectations**:
- **Transform table lookup**: 0.05-0.5ms
- **Traditional JOIN**: 5-50ms (depends on data size)
- **Speedup**: 10-100x faster for complex nested queries
- **Rust pipeline**: Automatic camelCase transformation and __typename injection

**When this applies**:
- Read-heavy workloads with stable data relationships
- Queries with fixed nesting patterns
- Applications where data freshness is less critical than speed

## Query Complexity Impact

### Complexity Scoring

FraiseQL calculates query complexity to prevent expensive operations:

```python
# Complexity calculation
complexity = field_count + (list_size * nested_fields) + multipliers

# Example multipliers
field_multipliers = {
    "search": 5,      # Text search operations
    "aggregate": 10,  # COUNT, SUM, AVG operations
    "sort": 2,        # ORDER BY clauses
}
```

### Performance by Complexity

| Complexity Score | Response Time | Use Case | Optimization Priority |
|------------------|---------------|----------|----------------------|
| 1-50 | 0.5-2ms | Simple lookups | Low |
| 51-200 | 2-10ms | Nested data | Medium |
| 201-500 | 10-50ms | Complex aggregations | High |
| 501-1000 | 50-200ms | Heavy computations | Critical |
| 1000+ | 200ms+ | Rejected | N/A |

### Optimization Strategies by Complexity

**Low Complexity (1-50)**:
- Focus on caching (APQ + result caching)
- Field projection for reduced data transfer
- Transform tables for instant responses

**Medium Complexity (51-200)**:
- Transform tables for nested relationships
- Database indexing optimization
- Query result caching
- Field projection optimization

## Hardware & Configuration Impact

### Recommended Hardware

**Development**:
- 2-4 CPU cores
- 4-8GB RAM
- Standard SSD storage

**Production (per instance)**:
- 4-8 CPU cores
- 8-16GB RAM
- Fast SSD storage
- 10-100GB storage for APQ cache

### PostgreSQL Configuration

```sql
-- Recommended for FraiseQL
shared_buffers = 256MB          -- 25% of RAM
effective_cache_size = 1GB       -- 75% of RAM
work_mem = 16MB                  -- Per-connection sort memory
max_connections = 100            -- Connection pool size
statement_timeout = 5000         -- Prevent long queries
```

### Connection Pooling

```python
# Recommended settings
config = FraiseQLConfig(
    database_pool_size=20,        # 20% of max_connections
    database_max_overflow=10,     # Burst capacity
    database_pool_timeout=5.0,    # Fail fast
)
```

## Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Response Time Percentiles** (p50, p95, p99)
2. **APQ Cache Hit Rate** (target: >85%)
3. **Database Connection Pool Utilization** (<80%)
4. **Query Complexity Distribution**
5. **Memory Usage Trends**

### Common Performance Issues

**Slow Queries (50-200ms)**:
```sql

SELECT schemaname, tablename, attname, n_distinct, correlation
FROM pg_stats
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename LIKE 'v_%';
```

**Low Cache Hit Rate (<80%)**:
- Review query patterns for stability
