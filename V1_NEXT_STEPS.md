**Technical Goals**:
- Sub-1ms query latency
- 40x speedup over traditional GraphQL
- Clean, showcase-quality code
- CQRS architecture mastery
- CLI codegen as "moat"

**Documentation Goals**:
- Philosophy-first approach
- Architectural depth
- Performance benchmarks
- Working examples

---

## 🚀 Recommended Path Forward

### **Option A: Documentation-First (RECOMMENDED)**

Start with the philosophy docs - these will be your "interview talk track":

**Week 1: Write the Philosophy**
```bash
cd /home/lionel/code/fraiseql
mkdir -p docs/philosophy

# Write these 3 docs first (your "pitch deck")
docs/philosophy/WHY_FRAISEQL.md          # The problem
docs/philosophy/CQRS_FIRST.md            # The solution
docs/philosophy/RUST_ACCELERATION.md     # The speed
```

**Why start with docs?**
- Clarifies your vision before coding
- Creates your interview narrative
- Documents decisions as you make them
- Can show docs alone to demonstrate thinking

**Week 2-4: Core Implementation**
Once philosophy is written, build the core:
1. Type System
2. Decorators
3. Repositories
4. Where Builder
5. Rust Integration

**Week 5-8: Examples & Polish**
Build showcase examples and remaining docs.

---

### **Option B: Code-First**

Jump straight into implementation:

**Week 1-2: Core Components**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/code/fraiseql-v1
cd ~/code/fraiseql-v1

# Set up project structure
pyproject.toml
src/fraiseql/
  __init__.py
  types/
  decorators/
  repositories/
  sql/
  core/
```

Start with Type System + Decorators (foundation).

**Week 3-4: CQRS Implementation**
Build CommandRepository and QueryRepository.

**Week 5-6: Rust Integration**
Port Rust transformer from v0.

**Week 7-8: Documentation**
Write docs after code is working.

**Trade-off**: Code works faster, but docs are rushed.

---

## 📝 Decision Point: Which Path?

**For Job Interviews**: Option A (Docs-First)
- You can show docs before code is done
- Demonstrates architectural thinking
- Creates talking points
- Philosophy docs = your "staff engineer interview prep"

**For Personal Learning**: Option B (Code-First)
- Get to working code faster
- Learn by doing
- Docs come from implementation learnings

**My recommendation**: **Option A (Docs-First)**

Here's why:
1. You already have working v0 to reference
2. Philosophy docs = interview prep material
3. Can share docs on LinkedIn/Twitter for visibility
4. Makes implementation easier (you know the plan)
5. Shows strategic thinking (top companies value this)

---

## 🎬 Immediate Next Actions

### If you choose **Option A (Docs-First)**:

```bash
# 1. Create docs structure
cd /home/lionel/code/fraiseql
mkdir -p docs/{philosophy,architecture,guides,api,examples}

# 2. Start with WHY_FRAISEQL.md
code docs/philosophy/WHY_FRAISEQL.md

# Use the template from V1_DOCUMENTATION_PLAN.md
# Aim for 300 lines, include:
# - The problem (current GraphQL is slow)
# - The solution (CQRS + Rust)
# - Performance comparison table
# - When to use (honest assessment)

# 3. Write CQRS_FIRST.md next
code docs/philosophy/CQRS_FIRST.md

# 4. Write RUST_ACCELERATION.md
code docs/philosophy/RUST_ACCELERATION.md

# 5. Practice your "interview pitch"
# - Read all 3 docs out loud
# - Time yourself (should be 10-15 min total)
# - This is your technical narrative!
```

**Timeline**: 1 week to complete philosophy trilogy
**Deliverable**: Can share on LinkedIn: "Building the fastest Python GraphQL framework"

---

### If you choose **Option B (Code-First)**:

```bash
# 1. Create new project
mkdir ~/code/fraiseql-v1
cd ~/code/fraiseql-v1

# 2. Initialize project
cat > pyproject.toml << 'EOF'
[project]
name = "fraiseql"
version = "1.0.0-alpha"
description = "The fastest Python GraphQL framework"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = [
    "fastapi>=0.109.0",
    "graphql-core>=3.2.0",
    "psycopg[pool]>=3.1.0",
    "fraiseql-rs>=0.1.0",  # Rust integration
]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
EOF

# 3. Create structure
mkdir -p src/fraiseql/{types,decorators,repositories,sql,core}
touch src/fraiseql/__init__.py

# 4. Start with types system
code src/fraiseql/types/fraise_type.py

# Copy from v0:
# /home/lionel/code/fraiseql/src/fraiseql/types/fraise_type.py
# Simplify, remove complexity

# 5. Write tests
mkdir tests
code tests/test_types.py
```

**Timeline**: 2 weeks to working core
**Deliverable**: Can run basic queries in 2 weeks

## 🎓 What This Demonstrates (For Interviews)

When you show FraiseQL v1 to hiring managers:

**Systems Thinking**:
- ✅ Identified GraphQL performance bottleneck
- ✅ Chose CQRS at database level (not app level)
- ✅ Rust integration for critical path

**Architectural Skill**:
- ✅ Clean separation (command/query)
- ✅ Explicit over magic (no hidden triggers)
- ✅ Naming conventions documented

**Engineering Judgment**:
- ✅ Rebuilt from scratch (knew when to start over)
- ✅ Honest trade-offs (docs mention when NOT to use)
- ✅ Focused v1 scope (removed feature bloat)

**Communication**:
- ✅ Philosophy-driven documentation
- ✅ Visual diagrams
- ✅ Working examples

**Strategic Vision**:
- ✅ CLI codegen as "moat"
- ✅ Competitive analysis (vs Strawberry, Graphene)
- ✅ Performance benchmarks

**Perfect for Staff+ interviews** - shows you can:
- Lead architectural decisions
- Balance trade-offs
- Document for team consumption
- Think long-term (codegen vision)

## 🔥 The Interview Story

Practice this narrative (memorize it!):

> "I built FraiseQL to solve a real problem I encountered: GraphQL in Python was too slow for production use at scale. Traditional frameworks like Strawberry and Graphene suffer from N+1 query problems and Python's object creation overhead.
>
> I took a systems-level approach. Instead of adding DataLoaders at the application layer, I implemented CQRS at the database level. The read side uses PostgreSQL's JSONB to pre-compute joins, eliminating N+1 queries entirely.
>
> But Python's JSON transformation was still a bottleneck. So I wrote a Rust extension that handles the snake_case to camelCase conversion, field selection, and type coercion. This gave us a 40x speedup.
>
> The result: sub-1ms query latency, from 60ms with traditional approaches. It's production-ready and handles [X] requests per second in my demo apps.
>
> The architecture demonstrates CQRS, database optimization, Rust integration, and API design. It's built to scale horizontally with PostgreSQL, not vertically with more Python servers."

**Time that**: Should be ~60 seconds, perfect for interview intro.

## 🚦 Go / No-Go Decision

**GREEN LIGHT** if you can commit to:
- ✅ 10-20 hours per week for 8 weeks
- ✅ Finishing what you start
- ✅ Public visibility (GitHub, blog posts)
- ✅ Using this for job interviews

**YELLOW LIGHT** if:
- ⚠️ Only 5-10 hours per week available
- ⚠️ Not comfortable with public visibility
- ⚠️ Want to keep it private

**RED LIGHT** if:
- ❌ No time for sustained effort
- ❌ Just want to learn (v0 is fine for that)
- ❌ Not planning to interview soon

## 📞 Final Question

**What do you want to do next?**

**Option 1**: Start writing WHY_FRAISEQL.md (docs-first path)
**Option 2**: Set up fraiseql-v1/ project structure (code-first path)
**Option 3**: Review/revise the blueprint first
**Option 4**: Something else?

I'm ready to help with any of these! Just let me know which direction you want to go.
