## Key Metrics & Numbers

### Steering Committee
- **Members**: 6 (CTO, CFO, Legal, VP Product, VP Ops, Program Mgr)
- **Meeting Frequency**: Weekly (Monday 2 PM, 1 hour)
- **Decision Authority**: 70+ decisions covered by RACI

- **Budget Authority**: Individual phase budgets ($80k-$300k per phase)
- **Authority**: Control phase design, approve success criteria, escalate blockers

### Resource Allocation
- **Internal Resources**: Most leads from existing teams (ops, QA, DevOps, observability)
- **External Specialists**: May need security, compliance, architecture (if internal expertise gap)
- **Budget Impact**: Depends on internal availability ($564k with internal, up to $800k with specialists)
