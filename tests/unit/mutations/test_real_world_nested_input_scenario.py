"""Real-world test scenario based on the original bug report.

This test replicates the exact scenario described in the bug report:
- Direct address creation works (streetNumber â†’ street_number)
- Nested address creation fails (streetNumber stays as streetNumber)

This test verifies that both now work consistently.
