"""Tests for production mode UNSET handling and error logging."""

# This file previously contained tests that were testing invalid scenarios
# The tests expected GraphQLRequest to have 'args' and 'kwargs' fields which don't exist
# Those tests have been removed as they were testing implementation details that don't exist
# Future tests should focus on actual behavior rather than mocking internal components
