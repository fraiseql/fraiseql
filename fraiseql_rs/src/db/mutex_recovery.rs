//! Mutex poisoning recovery utilities.
//!
//! This module provides graceful recovery mechanisms for poisoned mutexes.
//! When a thread panics while holding a mutex, Rust marks the mutex as "poisoned"
//! to alert other threads. However, in production systems, we want to degrade
//! gracefully rather than crashing the entire server.

use std::sync::{LockResult, MutexGuard};

/// Gracefully recover from a poisoned mutex by extracting the inner value.
///
/// When a mutex is poisoned (i.e., the previous thread that held the lock panicked),
/// we extract the inner value and continue. This allows the system to degrade gracefully
/// instead of panicking and potentially crashing the entire application.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `result` - The `LockResult` from calling `lock()` on a mutex
///
/// # Returns
///
/// The `MutexGuard` allowing access to the inner value, whether the mutex was
/// poisoned or not.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// use std::sync::Mutex;
/// use crate::db::mutex_recovery::recover_from_poisoned;
///
/// let mutex = Mutex::new(42);
/// let guard = recover_from_poisoned(mutex.lock());
/// assert_eq!(*guard, 42);
/// ```
///
/// # SAFETY
///
/// This function is safe to call. When a mutex is poisoned, we extract the
/// inner value with `into_inner()`, which returns a guard that allows us to
/// access and modify the data. The data itself is not corrupted; only the lock
/// was held by a panicking thread.
///
/// However, calling this function means we're assuming the data protected by
/// the mutex is still in a valid state. If the panicking thread left the data
/// in an inconsistent state, this could lead to subtle bugs. For this reason,
/// we log a warning when poisoning occurs.
