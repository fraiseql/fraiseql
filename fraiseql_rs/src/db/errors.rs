//! Error types for database operations with rich context.
//!
//! All errors include detailed context to facilitate debugging:
//! - What operation was attempted
//! - Why it failed (specific error code/message)
//! - Recovery hints where applicable
//!
//! # Error Classification
//!
//! - **Configuration errors** (400-level equivalent): Invalid setup, auth, missing credentials
//! - **Connectivity errors** (500-level equivalent): Network issues, pool exhaustion, timeouts
//! - **Query execution errors** (400-500 mixed): Syntax, deadlocks, constraint violations
//! - **Data access errors** (400-level): Type mismatches, missing columns, schema issues

    /// Indicates failure to create the database connection pool.

    /// - Invalid connection string or credentials

    /// - Insufficient resources

    /// Indicates timeout or failure when acquiring a connection from the pool.

    /// - All connections in use (pool exhausted)
    /// - Wait timeout exceeded
    /// - Database server down or slow
    /// - Connection lifecycle issue (dropped connection)
    ConnectionAcquisition(String),

    /// Query execution failed
    ///
    /// Indicates query failed to execute on the database.
    /// Can be categorized by message content:
    /// - Deadlock errors (retriable with backoff)
    /// - Syntax errors (non-retriable)
    /// - Constraint violations (non-retriable)
    /// - Timeout errors (retriable or adjustment needed)

    /// - Missing required parameters (wait_timeout, max_size)
    /// - Invalid parameter values (negative pool size)
    /// - SSL mode misconfiguration

    /// - Missing or invalid CA certificates

    /// - Column type mismatch (expected JSONB, got different type)
    /// - Missing column in result set
    /// - Schema mismatch between code and database
    /// - Data corruption
    ///
    /// **Debugging hints:**
    /// 1. Check that the query returns the expected columns
    /// 2. Verify column types in database schema
    /// 3. Ensure no recent schema changes
    /// 4. Check for data type conversions in the query
