# FraiseQL v0.9.2 Release Notes

## üêõ APQ Backend Integration Fix

**Release Date:** September 21, 2025

### Overview
FraiseQL v0.9.2 fixes a critical issue with Automatic Persisted Queries (APQ) backend integration that prevented custom storage backends from functioning correctly. This patch release enables production-ready APQ implementations with database-backed storage.

### What's Fixed

#### The Problem
In v0.9.0 and v0.9.1, custom APQ backends were not being called during request processing:
- `store_persisted_query()` method was never invoked during query registration
- `store_cached_response()` method was never called after successful execution
- Custom backends (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis) couldn't store queries or responses

#### The Solution
The router now properly integrates with custom APQ backends:
```python
# During APQ registration (query + hash)
if request.query:
    store_persisted_query(sha256_hash, request.query)
    if apq_backend:
        apq_backend.store_persisted_query(sha256_hash, request.query)

# During hash-only requests
if apq_backend:
    persisted_query_text = apq_backend.get_persisted_query(sha256_hash)

# After successful execution
if apq_backend:
    apq_backend.store_cached_response(apq_hash, response_json)
```

### Security & Multi-tenancy

‚úÖ **Full security context preserved:**
- JWT authentication happens before APQ processing
- Tenant ID from JWT metadata flows through entire request
- User context, permissions, and metadata remain intact
- Multi-tenant query isolation is maintained

### Impact

This fix enables:
- **Production APQ**: Database-backed persistent query storage
- **Distributed Caching**: Share queries across multiple servers
- **Custom Backends**: Implement APQ storage for your infrastructure
- **Performance**: Cache GraphQL responses at the storage layer

### Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Fully backward compatible with memory-only APQ
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to public APIs
- ‚úÖ All existing tests pass (3246 tests)
- ‚úÖ Works with all APQ client implementations

### Migration

No migration required. Simply upgrade to v0.9.2:

```bash
pip install --upgrade fraiseql==0.9.2
```

Custom backends will automatically start receiving storage calls.

### Testing

- 19 APQ-specific tests verify the fix
- Integration tests confirm backend methods are called
- Tenant ID preservation verified through APQ flow
- Full test suite maintains 100% pass rate

### Example Custom Backend

```python
from fraiseql.storage.backends import BaseAPQBackend

class CustomAPQBackend(BaseAPQBackend):
    def store_persisted_query(self, hash_value: str, query: str):
        # ‚úÖ This method is now called!
        self.db.save_query(hash_value, query)

    def get_persisted_query(self, hash_value: str) -> str | None:
        # ‚úÖ This method is now called!
        return self.db.get_query(hash_value)

    def store_cached_response(self, hash_value: str, response_json: str):
        # ‚úÖ This method is now called!
        self.cache.set(hash_value, response_json)
```
